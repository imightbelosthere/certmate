# CertMate Helm chart

Run [CertMate](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate) in Kubernetes.

```bash
helm install certmate oci://ghcr.io/fabriziosalmi/charts/certmate \
  --namespace certmate --create-namespace
kubectl -n certmate port-forward svc/certmate 8000:8000
```

The chart is published as an OCI artifact to GHCR on every release, so there
is no `helm repo add` step — Helm 3.8 and later pull `oci://` URLs directly.
It lives under `charts/` rather than beside the container image, because a
chart and an image in one OCI repository would fight over the same tags.

Argo CD `Application` and Flux `HelmRelease` examples, the first login and
production sizing are in [CertMate on Kubernetes](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate/blob/main/docs/kubernetes.md).

Or from a checkout, which is the same chart:

```bash
helm install certmate ./charts/certmate --namespace certmate --create-namespace
```

**The chart version is the CertMate version.** `--version X.Y.Z` gets the
chart that deploys CertMate X.Y.Z; omit it to take the newest. There is no
second number to reconcile, deliberately: every independent version copy in
this repository has drifted at least once — including, briefly, this very
sentence, which is why it now names no release.

## What this chart deliberately will not do

**It renders exactly one replica, and refuses anything else.** CertMate's
scheduler (APScheduler) runs inside the web process and gunicorn runs a single
worker on purpose. A second replica is a second scheduler issuing and renewing
against the same certificate store, and a second writer on a ReadWriteOnce
volume. `--set replicaCount=2` fails at template time with that explanation
rather than deploying something that looks healthy and quietly double-renews.

Scale the resources, not the replicas.

**It will not run without persistent storage.** Issued certificates, the
settings store, the certificate inventory and the tamper-evident audit chain
all live on disk. Disabling persistence without supplying
`persistence.existingClaim` fails at template time.

### Where the backups live

By default `/app/backups` is a subPath of the same claim as the certificates,
the settings store and the audit chain — the things the backups exist to
recover. **One volume loss therefore destroys the data and its restore points
together.** That is the default because a second claim is a real cost for a
small install, and because where backups belong is a fact about your
infrastructure rather than about CertMate.

Two ways out, in increasing order of how much they actually protect you:

```bash
# 1. Its own claim. Survives losing the pod and the data volume's contents;
#    a claim on the same storage class still shares a failure domain.
helm upgrade certmate ... --set persistence.backups.separateClaim=true

# 2. A claim on different storage that you manage.
helm upgrade certmate ... \
  --set persistence.backups.separateClaim=true \
  --set persistence.backups.existingClaim=nfs-certmate-backups

# 3. Off the cluster entirely: a CronJob copying /app/backups/unified out.
#    The image and command are yours; the backup volume is mounted read-only
#    so a misconfigured copy cannot damage what it is preserving.
#    See persistence.backups.offsite in values.yaml for a worked rclone example.
```

**None of this makes a backup restorable.** Unless `CERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE`
is set, automatic backups are written with secrets masked and cannot restore
the instance — copying those off-site preserves exactly that. Set the
passphrase first; the API reports `can_restore` per archive.

**The volume outlives the release.** The PVC carries
`helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so `helm uninstall` leaves your certificates
alone. Removing them is a deliberate `kubectl delete pvc`.

The rollout strategy is `Recreate` rather than `RollingUpdate`: a
ReadWriteOnce volume cannot be mounted by the new pod while the old one holds
it, so a rolling update would deadlock. Expect a few seconds of downtime on
upgrade.

## Secrets

`values.yaml` is not a secret store. For anything committed to git, create the
Secret yourself and point the chart at it:

```yaml
secrets:
  existingSecret: certmate-secrets
```

with keys such as `API_BEARER_TOKEN`, `SECRET_KEY` and whatever DNS provider
credentials you use (`CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN`, …). Everything in that Secret is
exposed to the container as environment variables.

Left empty, CertMate generates what it can on first boot — fine for a trial,
not for something you want to reproduce. With nothing supplied the chart
creates no Secret at all and mounts no environment from one, rather than
wiring up an empty object that looks like configuration.

The `secretRef` is **not** marked optional. If `existingSecret` names a Secret
that does not exist, the pod fails to start and says so, instead of coming up
without its credentials and turning a typo into a runtime mystery.

### Rotating an external Secret

The chart adds a checksum annotation so that changing values it *owns*
restarts the pod. It cannot do that for `existingSecret`: the chart does not
own that object, and reading it would require `lookup`, which returns nothing
during `helm template` and makes rendering depend on the live cluster —
breaking dry runs and GitOps diffs.

So after rotating an external Secret, restart the deployment yourself:

```bash
kubectl -n certmate rollout restart deployment/certmate
```

or run a controller that does it for you, such as
[stakater/Reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader).

## Additional volumes

Use `extraVolumes` and `extraVolumeMounts` to mount existing Kubernetes
ConfigMaps, Secrets, PVCs or other volume sources in the CertMate container:

```yaml
extraVolumes:
  - name: config
    configMap:
      name: certmate-config
  - name: credentials
    secret:
      secretName: certmate-credentials
  - name: shared-data
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: certmate-shared-data
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: config
    mountPath: /app/config-extra
    readOnly: true
  - name: credentials
    mountPath: /app/credentials
    readOnly: true
  - name: shared-data
    mountPath: /app/shared
```

The referenced ConfigMaps, Secrets and claims must exist in the release
namespace. These values add mounts only to the CertMate Deployment, not the
off-site backup CronJob. Avoid paths already used by the chart (`/app/data`,
`/app/certificates`, `/app/logs` and `/app/backups`).
The volume names `data` and `backups` are taken by the chart, and Kubernetes
rejects a Deployment with two volumes of the same name.

### Deploy-hook scripts from a ConfigMap

CertMate runs a deploy hook as `sh -c <command>`. Files from a ConfigMap are
mounted with mode `0644` by default, so a hook whose command is the script's
path fails with `Permission denied` (exit 126). Measured in the CertMate image.
Mount them executable:

```yaml
extraVolumes:
  - name: hooks
    configMap:
      name: certmate-hooks
      defaultMode: 0755
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: hooks
    mountPath: /app/hooks
    readOnly: true
```

Then the hook command can be `/app/hooks/reload.sh`. Without `defaultMode`,
write it as `sh /app/hooks/reload.sh` instead.

## Common values

| key | default | note |
|---|---|---|
| `image.tag` | chart `appVersion` | pin a digest for production |
| `persistence.size` | `2Gi` | certificates, inventory, audit chain, and backups unless moved (below) |
| `persistence.existingClaim` | `""` | bring your own volume |
| `persistence.backups.separateClaim` | `false` | give `/app/backups` its own claim |
| `persistence.backups.existingClaim` | `""` | a backup volume you manage — the one that actually leaves the failure domain |
| `persistence.backups.offsite.enabled` | `false` | CronJob copying the archives somewhere else; you choose the image and command |
| `env.behindProxy` | `true` | correct when traffic arrives via Ingress |
| `env.gunicornTimeout` | `300` | raise for slow DNS providers |
| `ingress.enabled` | `false` | |
| `secrets.existingSecret` | `""` | strongly preferred over inline values |
| `extraVolumes`, `extraVolumeMounts` | `[]` | additional Kubernetes volumes and CertMate container mounts |

## OpenShift

The image's writable trees are group 0 with setgid, so an arbitrary assigned
UID works. Clear the values that would fight the SCC:

```bash
helm install certmate ./charts/certmate \
  --set podSecurityContext.runAsUser=null \
  --set podSecurityContext.fsGroup=null
```

## Where this fits

If everything needing TLS is an in-cluster Ingress, **cert-manager** is the
right tool and we say so in the
[deployment guide](https://www.certmate.org/deploy/kubernetes). CertMate earns
its place when certificates also have to reach things that are not Ingresses —
load balancers, appliances, hosts outside the cluster — and when you want one
inventory, audit trail and expiry view across all of them.
