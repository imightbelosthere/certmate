## Feature Overview

### Server Certificates

## Testing

All features are thoroughly tested:

```bash
# Run tests
# The UI suite drives Playwright against a live server and cannot share
# a process with the rest; e2e needs a running instance. Same selection
# `make test` and scripts/release.sh use.
pytest -v --tb=short -m "not ui and not e2e"
```

Test coverage includes:
- CA Operations
- CSR Operations
- Certificate Lifecycle
- Filtering & Search
- Batch Operations
- OCSP & CRL
- Audit & Rate Limiting

---

## Security Features

- **4096-bit RSA** for CA keys
- **SHA256** signature algorithm
- **Bearer token** authentication
- **Rate limiting** on all endpoints
- **Audit logging** of all operations
- **File permissions** 0600 for private keys

---

## Performance

- Supports **30k+ concurrent certificates**
- Efficient **multi-filter queries**
- **Auto-renewal** scheduling
- **Batch operations** with error tracking

## Test status

There is no hand-maintained scorecard here. A table of test counts is stale the day after it is written — this one said `27/27` while the suite had grown past two thousand.

The authoritative signal is CI on `main`: the badges at the top of the [project README](../README.md), and the coverage floor enforced in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Quick Examples

### Create a Certificate via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/client-certs/create \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
 "common_name": "user@example.com",
 "organization": "ACME Corp",
 "cert_usage": "api-mtls",
 "days_valid": 365
 }'
```

### List Certificates

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/client-certs \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Download Certificate

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/client-certs/USER_ID/download/crt \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
 -o certificate.crt
```
