# Docker Build & Deployment

This guide covers building, deploying, and running CertMate in Docker — including multi-platform support for ARM and AMD64.

---

## Production with Docker Compose

The shortest way to run CertMate in production: one file, the published image, nothing to build and no repository to clone.

```bash
mkdir certmate && cd certmate
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate/main/deploy/docker-compose.yml
printf 'API_BEARER_TOKEN=%s\nSECRET_KEY=%s\nCERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE=%s\n' \
  "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > .env
chmod 600 .env
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The first page creates the administrator account and asks for the `API_BEARER_TOKEN` from `.env` to authorize it. Keep `.env`: it holds the token API clients use, the key that signs sessions, and the passphrase without which a backup cannot restore this instance.

What the file does:

- **Pins the image** of the latest release. The copy on `main` is updated with every release. To stay on a version, set `CERTMATE_VERSION=X.Y.Z` in `.env`.
- **Keeps everything in named volumes** (`certificates`, `data`, `logs`, `backups`). Docker creates them with the ownership CertMate needs, so there is nothing to `chown`. `docker compose down` keeps them; `down -v` deletes them.
- **Listens on 127.0.0.1 only.** For remote access, put a reverse proxy in front and set `BEHIND_PROXY=true`. Setting `CERTMATE_BIND=0.0.0.0` publishes it on every interface. `CERTMATE_PORT` changes the host port.
- **Refuses to start without `API_BEARER_TOKEN` and `SECRET_KEY`**, instead of generating values that would change every time the container is recreated.

Optional variables for `.env`: `CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN` (bootstraps a Cloudflare DNS account on first start), `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL`, `BEHIND_PROXY`.

**Upgrade:** download the file again (or change `CERTMATE_VERSION`), then run `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

The `docker-compose.yml` at the root of the repository builds the image from source and is meant for development.

---

## Portainer

In Portainer, deploy the [production compose bundle](#production-with-docker-compose) as a stack straight from this repository:

1. **Stacks → Add stack**, name it `certmate`, and choose **Repository**.
2. Repository URL `https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate`, reference `refs/heads/main`, compose path `deploy/docker-compose.yml`.
3. Under **Environment variables**, add `API_BEARER_TOKEN`, `SECRET_KEY` and `CERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE`, each a long random value such as the output of `openssl rand -hex 32`. Optionally add `CERTMATE_PORT`, `CERTMATE_BIND` or `CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN`.
4. **Deploy the stack.**

Without the two required variables the deployment fails and says which one is missing (`required variable API_BEARER_TOKEN is missing a value`), rather than starting with keys that change on every redeploy. To upgrade, use **Pull and redeploy** on the stack: the named volumes, and so the certificates and settings, are kept.

Checked on Portainer CE 2.45: a stack without the variables is refused with that message; with them it comes up healthy, the token authorises the API, and a pull-and-redeploy recreates the container with its data intact.

---

## Quick Start

### Pull and Run

Images are published to Docker Hub as `fabriziosalmi/certmate`. Releases after v2.42.0 are also published, with the same tags, to GHCR as `ghcr.io/fabriziosalmi/certmate`, which avoids Docker Hub's anonymous pull limits: use either name below.

```bash
# Docker automatically selects the right architecture
docker run -d --name certmate \
  --env-file .env \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v certmate_data:/app/data \
  -v certmate_certificates:/app/certificates \
  fabriziosalmi/certmate:latest
```

### Build and Run Locally

```bash
docker build -t certmate:latest .
docker run -d --name certmate \
  --env-file .env \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v certmate_certificates:/app/certificates \
  -v certmate_data:/app/data \
  -v certmate_logs:/app/logs \
  certmate:latest
```

---

## Security

The build process ensures no secrets are included in the image:

- `.dockerignore` excludes all `.env` files and sensitive data
- Environment variables are provided at **runtime**, not build time
- Only essential application files are included
- Images can be safely pushed to public registries

### Verify No Secrets in Image

```bash
docker history certmate:latest
docker inspect certmate:latest | grep -i env
docker run --rm certmate:latest find / -name "*.env" 2>/dev/null
```

---

## Runtime Configuration

### Option 1: Environment File

Create a `.env` file on your host (not in the Docker image):

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
# SECRET_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/secret_key  # Alternative: takes precedence over SECRET_KEY
# Set API_BEARER_TOKEN before exposing a not-yet-onboarded instance to a
# network: until the first admin exists, an instance with no token serves the
# setup bypass to anyone who can reach it. When set, paste it once on the
# first-run screen to create the admin.
API_BEARER_TOKEN=your-api-bearer-token-here
# API_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE=/run/secrets/api_bearer_token  # Alternative: takes precedence over API_BEARER_TOKEN
CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-api-token
CERTMATE_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

```bash
docker run -d --name certmate \
  --env-file .env \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v certmate_certificates:/app/certificates \
  -v certmate_data:/app/data \
  -v certmate_logs:/app/logs \
  certmate:latest
```

### Option 2: Direct Environment Variables

```bash
docker run -d --name certmate \
  -e SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key" \
  # -e SECRET_KEY_FILE="/run/secrets/secret_key" \  # Alternative: takes precedence over SECRET_KEY
  -e API_BEARER_TOKEN="your-api-bearer-token" \
  # -e API_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE="/run/secrets/api_bearer_token" \  # Alternative: takes precedence over API_BEARER_TOKEN
  -e CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN="your-api-token" \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v certmate_certificates:/app/certificates \
  -v certmate_data:/app/data \
  certmate:latest
```

### Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | No | Flask secret key for sessions (auto-generated if unset) |
| `SECRET_KEY_FILE` | No | Path to a file containing the Flask secret key (takes precedence over `SECRET_KEY`). If set and the file cannot be read or is empty, CertMate refuses to start: a secret that failed to mount is a configuration error, and generating a key instead would sign out every user, on every restart, with sessions signed by a key you did not choose. |
| `API_BEARER_TOKEN` | No (auto-generated) | API auth token. Auto-generated if unset, but set it before exposing a not-yet-onboarded instance to a network; when set, paste it once on the first-run screen to create the admin. **This value is authoritative:** if it differs from the token already stored, the stored one is replaced at startup and stops working. That is what makes adding or rotating the variable on an existing install take effect — previously enforcement used this value while authentication still checked the old one, and the first-run screen asked for a token it then rejected |
| `API_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE` | No | Path to a file containing the API bearer token (takes precedence over `API_BEARER_TOKEN`) |
| `CERTMATE_LOG_LEVEL` | No | `INFO` (default), `DEBUG`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` |
| `CERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` | **Set it if you want automatic backups you can restore from** | Encrypts unified backups at rest (`.zip.enc`, PBKDF2-SHA256 + Fernet), and is what makes automatic backups *complete* — with it they can restore this instance, without it they keep their credentials masked and cannot. The same passphrase is required to restore them, and CertMate never stores it for you. Keep it somewhere other than the machine holding the backups |
| `CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN` | No | API token for the default Cloudflare DNS account. Cloudflare is the only DNS provider read from the environment: Route53 and the others are configured in Settings → DNS Providers or through the API, and setting `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` in the container does nothing |

See the [Installation Guide](./installation.md#environment-variables) for the complete list.

### Keeping DNS tokens out of `settings.json`

DNS provider tokens configured through the UI are stored in `settings.json`,
which is the file that gets backed up, copied and mounted. Any credential field
can instead **name** where its value lives — `api_token_file` with a path, or
`api_token_env` with a variable name — the same way `API_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE`
works. The value is read when certbot runs and is never written back. The OIDC
`client_secret` accepts the same pair. See
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate/blob/main/SECURITY.md#keeping-credentials-out-of-settingsjson).

## Docker Compose

### Basic Setup

```yaml
services:
  certmate:
    image: fabriziosalmi/certmate:latest
    container_name: certmate
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8000:8000"  # localhost only; put a reverse proxy in front for external access
    environment:
      - SECRET_KEY=${SECRET_KEY:-}
      # - SECRET_KEY_FILE=${SECRET_KEY_FILE:-}  # Alternative: path to a file containing the secret key
      - API_BEARER_TOKEN=${API_BEARER_TOKEN:-}
      # - API_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE=${API_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE:-}  # Alternative: path to a file containing the bearer token
      - CERTMATE_LOG_LEVEL=${CERTMATE_LOG_LEVEL:-INFO}
    volumes:
      - certmate_certificates:/app/certificates
      - certmate_data:/app/data
      - certmate_logs:/app/logs
      - certmate_backups:/app/backups
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s

volumes:
  certmate_certificates:
  certmate_data:
  certmate_logs:
  certmate_backups:
```

```bash
# Start with .env file in the same directory
docker-compose up -d

# Or specify a different env file
docker-compose --env-file /path/to/.env up -d
```

## Podman (Quadlet, rootless) and OpenShift

### Quadlet: CertMate as a systemd service

[`deploy/podman/certmate.container`](../deploy/podman/certmate.container) is a Quadlet unit: Podman turns it into a systemd service. It runs the published image with named volumes, the port on loopback only, the secrets as Podman secrets, a healthcheck, and `podman auto-update` support.

Rootless, as your own user:

```bash
# The three secrets, created once. They never appear in a file.
for s in certmate-api-token certmate-secret-key certmate-backup-passphrase; do
  openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d '\n' | podman secret create "$s" -
done

mkdir -p ~/.config/containers/systemd
curl -fsSL -o ~/.config/containers/systemd/certmate.container \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate/main/deploy/podman/certmate.container
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user start certmate

# Keep it running without a login session, and start it at boot.
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

Rootful instead: put the file in `/etc/containers/systemd/`, create the secrets as root, then run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl start certmate`.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The first page creates the administrator account and asks for the API token: `podman secret inspect --showsecret certmate-api-token --format '{{.SecretData}}'`.

Checked on Fedora 44 with Podman 5.8, rootful and rootless: the service starts healthy, the token authorises the API, and it comes back after a reboot (rootless through lingering).

### Arbitrary UIDs (rootless Podman, OpenShift)

The image runs as the non-root user `1000` by default, but it also follows the
OpenShift **arbitrary-UID** pattern: the runtime-writable directories
(`/app/data`, `/app/certificates`, `/app/logs`, `/app/backups`) are owned by
**group 0 (root group)** and are group-writable + setgid. A container process
running as *any* UID that belongs to group 0 — which is how rootless podman and
OpenShift launch containers — can therefore create and rename files without a
manual `chown -R 1000:1000` of the volumes. Secret files the app writes (the CA
private key, the audit-signing key, DNS credential files, `.secret_key`) are
always created `0600` owner-only, so the group-writable directories never expose
a key. (Issue [#380](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate/issues/380).)

### Named volumes

A fresh **named volume** inherits the image's group-0 permissions under rootful
Podman and Docker. Under **rootless** Podman it does not always: measured on
Podman 5.8, the root of the `backups` volume, whose image directory is not
empty, stayed owned by root, and CertMate refused to start with *"Required
directories are not writable"*. Add `:U`, which gives each volume to the
container's user:

```bash
podman run -d --name certmate \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \
  -v certmate_data:/app/data:U \
  -v certmate_certificates:/app/certificates:U \
  -v certmate_logs:/app/logs:U \
  -v certmate_backups:/app/backups:U \
  docker.io/fabriziosalmi/certmate:latest
```

### Bind mounts (host directories)

A bind mount keeps the **host** directory's ownership, which shadows the image's
permissions. Make the host directories writable by group 0 once, then run:

```bash
# Create the host dirs group-0 writable (any UID in group 0 can write)
mkdir -p ./{data,certificates,logs,backups}
chgrp -R 0 ./{data,certificates,logs,backups}
chmod -R g+rwX ./{data,certificates,logs,backups}

podman run -d --name certmate \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  -v ./certificates:/app/certificates \
  -v ./logs:/app/logs \
  -v ./backups:/app/backups \
  docker.io/fabriziosalmi/certmate:latest
```

Alternatively let podman fix the ownership for you with the `:U` mount option
(recursively chowns the source to match the container UID/GID):

```bash
podman run -d --name certmate \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ./data:/app/data:U \
  -v ./certificates:/app/certificates:U \
  -v ./logs:/app/logs:U \
  -v ./backups:/app/backups:U \
  docker.io/fabriziosalmi/certmate:latest
```

### rootless podman-compose

```yaml
services:
  certmate:
    image: docker.io/fabriziosalmi/certmate:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - certmate_data:/app/data:U
      - certmate_certificates:/app/certificates:U
      - certmate_logs:/app/logs:U
      - certmate_backups:/app/backups:U
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  certmate_data:
  certmate_certificates:
  certmate_logs:
  certmate_backups:
```

If startup aborts with *"Required directories are not writable by the CertMate
process"*, the mount is not writable by the container's user — add `:U` to
the volume, or for a bind mount apply the `chgrp 0 … && chmod g+rwX …` above.

> **Kubernetes / OpenShift:** no changes needed. Set
> `spec.securityContext.fsGroup: 0` (or rely on the default restricted SCC,
> which already assigns an arbitrary UID in group 0) and the mounted volumes
> become group-0 writable automatically.

---

## Upgrading

CertMate keeps all persistent state in the mounted volumes — chiefly `./data`
(`settings.json`, the admin users, the auto-generated `.secret_key`, the audit
signing key, and the scheduler database) and `./certificates`. Because state
lives in those volumes and **not** in the image, upgrading is just pulling a
newer image and recreating the container; your configuration, certificates, and
login carry forward.

```bash
# Recommended: take a backup first (Settings → Backup, or the API)

# Docker Compose
docker compose pull          # fetch the new image
docker compose up -d         # recreate the container (data/ + certificates/ persist)

# Plain docker run — stop/remove and re-run with the SAME volume mounts
docker pull fabriziosalmi/certmate:latest
docker rm -f certmate
docker run -d --name certmate --env-file .env -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" -v "$(pwd)/certificates:/app/certificates" \
  -v "$(pwd)/logs:/app/logs" -v "$(pwd)/backups:/app/backups" \
  fabriziosalmi/certmate:latest
```

Settings-format migrations run automatically on boot. For production, pin a
version tag (e.g. `fabriziosalmi/certmate:2.19`) instead of `:latest` so repulls
don't surprise you with an unintended upgrade — the multi-platform build
publishes `MAJOR`, `MAJOR.MINOR`, and `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tags.

---

## Multi-Platform Builds

CertMate supports multi-platform Docker images for both ARM and AMD64 architectures.

### Supported Architectures

| Platform | Description | Common Use Cases |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `linux/amd64` | Intel/AMD 64-bit | Most cloud servers, desktops |
| `linux/arm64` | ARM 64-bit | Apple Silicon, ARM cloud instances |
| `linux/arm/v7` | ARM 32-bit v7 | Raspberry Pi 3+ — **not published**: buildable on request (see below), the release images are amd64 + arm64 |
| `linux/arm/v6` | ARM 32-bit v6 | Raspberry Pi 1, Zero |

### Build Scripts

```bash
# Build for current platform only
./build-docker.sh

# Build for multiple platforms (ARM64 + AMD64)
./build-docker.sh -m

# Build and push to Docker Hub
./build-docker.sh -m -p -r YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME

# Dedicated multi-platform script
./build-multiplatform.sh -r USERNAME -v v1.0.0 -p

# Build for Raspberry Pi
./build-multiplatform.sh --platforms linux/arm/v7 -r USERNAME -p
```

### Manual Docker Buildx

```bash
# Create and use buildx builder
docker buildx create --name certmate-builder --use

# Build for multiple platforms
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t USERNAME/certmate:latest .

# Build and push
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t USERNAME/certmate:latest --push .
```

### Prerequisites for Multi-Platform

```bash
# Verify buildx support
docker buildx version
docker buildx inspect --bootstrap

# Enable QEMU emulation (if needed)
docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
```

### Force Specific Platform

```bash
# Force AMD64 (e.g., on Apple Silicon for testing)
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --rm \
  --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 certmate:latest

# Auto-detect (recommended)
docker run --rm --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 certmate:latest
```

---

## Pushing to Docker Hub

```bash
# Login
docker login

# Tag and push
docker build -t USERNAME/certmate:latest .
docker push USERNAME/certmate:latest

# With version tag
docker build -t USERNAME/certmate:v1.0.0 .
docker push USERNAME/certmate:v1.0.0
```

---

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

Required secrets:
- `DOCKERHUB_USER`
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`

```bash
# Manual trigger with custom platforms
gh workflow run docker-multiplatform.yml \
  -f platforms="linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7" \
  -f push_to_registry=true
```

---

## Production Tips

1. **Use secrets management**: Docker secrets, Kubernetes secrets, or a secrets manager
2. **Enable TLS**: Run behind a reverse proxy with TLS termination
3. **Monitor resources**: Set CPU and memory limits
4. **Backup volumes**: Regularly backup certificate and data volumes
5. **Update regularly**: Keep the image updated with security patches
6. **Use layer caching** for faster builds:
   ```bash
   docker buildx build --cache-from type=registry,ref=USERNAME/certmate:cache .
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Container Won't Start

```bash
docker logs certmate
docker exec certmate env
```

### Health Check Fails

```bash
docker logs certmate
docker exec certmate curl -v http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Permission Issues

```bash
docker exec certmate ls -la /app/certificates
docker exec certmate ls -la /app/data
```

### Multi-Platform Build Issues

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "multiple platforms not supported for docker driver" | `docker buildx create --name multiplatform --use` |
| "exec format error" | `docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all` |
| Slow non-native builds | Normal due to emulation; use GitHub Actions for production |
| Cannot load multi-platform to local Docker | Use `--load` with single platform for local testing |

---

## Image Sizes

Typical sizes per architecture:
- **AMD64**: ~200-300 MB
- **ARM64**: ~200-300 MB
- **ARM v7**: ~180-250 MB
