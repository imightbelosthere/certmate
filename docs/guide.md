#### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/client-certs/create \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
 "common_name": "user@example.com",
 "email": "user@example.com",
 "organization": "ACME Corp",

 - **KEY** - Private key (keep secret)
 - **CSR** - Certificate Signing Request

#### Via API

```bash
# Download certificate
curl http://localhost:8000/api/client-certs/CERT_ID/download/crt \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
 -o my-cert.crt

## Auto-Renewal

### Configuration

- **Check Time**: Daily at 3 AM
- **Threshold**: 30 days before expiry
- **Action**: Automatic renewal if enabled

### When the CA disagrees with the threshold (ARI)

The 30-day threshold is CertMate's opinion, and it is the same opinion for
every certificate and every CA. Since [RFC 9773](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9773.html)
a CA can publish its own, per certificate: a `renewalInfo` endpoint answering a
window during which it wants that certificate replaced. Let's Encrypt serves
one, in production and on staging. step-ca does not yet (0.30.2, measured; see
smallstep/certificates#2162), so on a private step-ca the threshold decides
alone and the certificate panel says the CA does not publish a window.

The TLS renewal sweep asks. For every certificate the threshold has **not**
already called due, CertMate fetches the CA's window and renews now if that
window says so. This is how an instance learns about a batch replacement — a
mis-issuance, a compromised intermediate, a CA/Browser Forum ruling — days
before the revocation lands, instead of when the certificate stops working.

**It can only bring a renewal forward.** Your threshold stays the backstop, so
a CA that is down, slow or wrong cannot delay a renewal that would otherwise
have happened. Every absence — a CA that publishes no `renewalInfo`, an
unreachable endpoint, a malformed answer, a self-signed certificate with no
Authority Key Identifier to name it by — falls back to the threshold.

Within the window CertMate picks one point, derived from the certificate's own
identifier, so the choice is the same on every sweep and two certificates do
not land on the same instant. That is what the window is for: a CA does not
want all of its clients renewing at once.

The sweep summary counts these as `ari_advanced`, so a renewal your
configuration does not explain is attributable.

The certificate's detail panel shows what the CA said at the last sweep, under
**CA renewal window**: the window, the instant inside it at which CertMate
renews, and the CA's explanation link when it gave one. When there is no
window it says which absence it is: the CA publishes none, the CA did not
answer at the last check, or the certificate cannot be named in ARI. The same
record is returned as `renewal_info` by `GET /api/certificates/<domain>`. It is
read from what the sweep kept, so opening the dashboard never sends a request
to the CA. Right after a renewal it reads "Not checked yet" until the next
sweep asks about the new certificate.

Set `"ari_enabled": false` in `settings.json` to turn it off; it is on by
default and costs one unauthenticated GET per certificate per sweep, plus one
per CA per hour for the directory.

Not yet done, and deliberately: letting ARI *defer* a renewal past your
threshold. That is the half that matters for short-lived certificates, where a
fixed 30-day rule is meaningless against a 6-day certificate — it arrives with
the profile support those certificates need.

### A threshold above 30 days

certbot has a renewal gate of its own: without being forced, it renews only
inside 30 days of expiry. Before 2.40 CertMate asked it unforced, so a
`renewal_threshold_days` of 45 behaved as 30, and the sweep counted the gap as
`skipped_not_due` every night.

When the threshold, and only the threshold, calls a certificate due while
certbot would refuse, CertMate now forces the renewal, as it already did for a
window the CA published. Inside the last 30 days nothing changes. Two guards
come with it:

- **At most `early_renewals_per_sweep` a sweep** (default 10, between 1 and
  50). Raising the threshold on a large estate spreads the early renewals over
  several nights instead of sending every order to the CA in one. The sweep
  summary counts them as `early_forced`, and the ones left for the next sweep
  as `early_deferred`.
- **A certificate issued less than 7 days ago is never forced.** A threshold at
  or above the certificate's lifetime would otherwise call it due forever. With
  this guard it costs at most one renewal a week, not one a night.

A certificate that needs attention for another reason, a served key that is
missing or does not match, is not forced: it is repaired from its lineage
without a new key.

### Enabling Auto-Renewal

Auto-renewal is enabled by default. To check status:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/client-certs/CERT_ID \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

Look for:
```json
{
 "renewal": {
 "renewal_enabled": true,
 "renewal_threshold_days": 30
 }
}
```

### Renewal Behavior

When auto-renewed:
- New certificate created
- Same CN (common name)
- New serial number
- New expiration date
- Original ID remains same
- Old certificate replaced

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Certificate Creation Failed

**Error**: `Failed to create certificate`

**Solutions**:
1. Check common name is valid
2. Verify all required fields
3. Check CA is initialized
4. Review logs for details

#### File Download Failed

**Error**: `File not found`

**Solutions**:
1. Verify certificate ID exists
2. Check file type (crt, key, csr)
3. Ensure certificate hasn't been deleted
4. Check disk space

#### Rate Limit Exceeded

**Error**: `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`

**Solutions**:
1. Wait before retrying
2. Use batch operations
3. Implement exponential backoff
4. Check limit for your endpoint

The body says which limit you hit. `"code": "ISSUANCE_QUEUE_FULL"` means too
many certificate jobs are queued or running: retry once some finish, or raise
`CERTMATE_ISSUANCE_QUEUE_LIMIT` / `CERTMATE_ISSUANCE_WORKERS`. The API rate
limit and the login-attempt limit both return `retry_after` in seconds.

### Checking Logs

View application logs (CertMate logs to stdout):
```bash
docker logs -f certmate
```

A log file exists only if you set `CERTMATE_LOG_FILE` (e.g.
`CERTMATE_LOG_FILE=/app/logs/certmate.log`); then `tail -f` that path.

View audit logs:
```bash
tail -f logs/audit/certificate_audit.log
```

## Security Best Practices

### Private Keys

- **NEVER** share your private keys
- **NEVER** commit keys to git
- Store keys securely
- Use 0600 file permissions

### Certificates

- Monitor expiration dates
- Renew before expiry
- Revoke compromised certs immediately
- Keep audit logs for compliance

### API Tokens

- Rotate tokens regularly
- Use HTTPS in production
- Don't hardcode tokens
- Use environment variables

### Revocation

Always revoke when:
- Key is compromised
- Certificate is replaced
- User leaves organization
- Service is decommissioned

---

## Performance Tips

### For Large Batches

Use batch operations instead of individual creates:
```bash
# Good: One request for 1000 certs
POST /api/client-certs/batch

# Bad: 1000 requests for 1000 certs
POST /api/client-certs/create × 1000
```

### For Filtering

Filter on the server side:
```bash
# Good: Server filters
GET /api/client-certs?usage=api-mtls

# Bad: Client filters all
GET /api/client-certs
```

### For Monitoring

Use statistics endpoint:
```bash
GET /api/client-certs/stats
```
