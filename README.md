# CertMate - Certificate Lifecycle Management

<div align="center">

<img src="certmate_logo.png" alt="CertMate Logo" width="180">

**CertMate** is a self-hosted certificate lifecycle management platform: it issues and renews TLS certificates, **discovers the ones you did not issue**, keeps a single inventory of what exists across your estate — what is served where, who issued it, when it expires, which cryptography it uses — and deploys renewed certificates to where they are needed. It supports 29 DNS providers, runs its own private CA for internal names, keeps a tamper-evident audit trail of every operation, and exposes all of it through a REST API.

## Ecosystem

CertMate is the open-source core of a small, focused toolset:

- **[certmate-tools](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate-tools)** — free, privacy-first, client-side TLS / certificate / ACME diagnostics (runs entirely in your browser).
- **[certmate-agent](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate-agent)** — conversational assistant: a local LLM mapped 1:1 to CertMate's REST API, with RAG over the docs.
- **[nis2-public](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/nis2-public)** — NIS2 continuous posture management & remediation.

**Enterprise / high-scale** — multi-tenant, mTLS, white-label and NIS2-aligned deployments are available through *CertMate-ng* (source-available, BSL 1.1, EU-built). For access or a deployment discussion, email **fabrizio.salmi@gmail.com**.

---

## Command-line interface

The whole certificate lifecycle from your terminal — `pip install certmate-cli`:

![CertMate CLI — the full SSL certificate lifecycle from the terminal](demo/certmate-cli.gif)

```bash
pip install certmate-cli

export CERTMATE_URL=https://certmate.example.com
export CERTMATE_TOKEN=...                 # omit on a fresh (setup-mode) instance

certmate health
certmate cert create app.example.com --dns cloudflare --wait   # issue, block until live
certmate cert ls
certmate cert info app.example.com
certmate audit verify
```

`certmate-cli` is a thin layer over **`certmate-sdk`** (`pip install certmate-sdk`) — a small,
`httpx`-based Python client for the same REST API the web UI and MCP server drive. Both are
first-party, live in [`clients/`](clients/), and are published to PyPI. The clip above is a real
issuance over DNS-01 (Let's Encrypt staging); see [`demo/`](demo/).

---

## AI agents (MCP server)

CertMate ships a first-party **Model Context Protocol** server, so an assistant like Claude can
drive the same REST API the web UI and the CLI use — with the same auth and the same audit trail.
It lives in [`mcp/`](mcp/), is Node.js (>= 20), and exposes **16 tools**: inventory and status
(`certmate_list_certificates`, `certmate_get_certificate`, `certmate_diagnostics`,
`certmate_get_activity`, …), lifecycle operations (`certmate_create_certificate`,
`certmate_renew_certificate`, `certmate_get_job`, `certmate_set_auto_renew`, …), and delivery
(`certmate_download_certificate`, `certmate_deploy_certificate`).

```bash
cd mcp && npm install
```

```jsonc
// claude_desktop_config.json — or any MCP-capable client
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "certmate": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/certmate/mcp/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "CERTMATE_URL": "https://certmate.example.com",
        "CERTMATE_TOKEN": "<a scoped API key with is_agent: true>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Give it a scoped key, not your admin token.** A key created with `is_agent: true` (a checkbox
under Settings → API Keys, or `is_agent` in `POST /api/keys`) makes every action the agent takes
land in the audit chain as `actor.kind="agent"` rather than being indistinguishable from a human
operator — which is the difference between an audit trail and a rumour. Scope the key to the
domains the agent is allowed to touch.

Full tool reference, attribution model and safety notes: **[docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md)**.

## Why CertMate?

CertMate solves the complexity of SSL certificate management in modern distributed architectures. Whether you're running a single application or managing certificates across multiple datacenters, CertMate provides:

- **Zero-Downtime Automation** - Certificates renew automatically 30 days before expiry, with deploy hooks to reload services
- **Multi-Cloud Support** - Cloudflare, AWS, Azure, GCP, Akamai Edge DNS, Hetzner, Porkbun, GoDaddy and the rest — [docs/dns-providers.md](docs/dns-providers.md) has the full list
- **Enterprise-Ready** - RBAC, scoped API keys, Docker, Kubernetes, REST API, and monitoring built-in
- **Simple Integration** - One-URL certificate downloads for easy automation
- **Security-First** - Role-based access control, scoped API keys, audit logging, HMAC-signed webhooks
- **Unified Backup System** - Atomic backups of settings and certificates ensuring data consistency
- **Real-Time Dashboard** - SSE-powered live updates, command palette, keyboard shortcuts, dark mode

> **CertMate runs as a single instance.** Its renewal scheduler runs inside the
> web process, so a second replica is a second scheduler issuing against the
> same certificate store — duplicate ACME orders, and the CA's
> duplicate-certificate rate limit. The Helm chart refuses to render more than
> one replica rather than let that happen quietly.
>
> This is a deliberate design choice, not a missing feature: one writer is what
> makes certificate state safe without a distributed lock service. It scales
> *up* (a single instance manages thousands of certificates across many
> datacenters), not *out*. For availability, run active/standby with the data
> volume on shared storage and fail over — see
> [Availability and failover](docs/architecture.md#availability-and-failover).

| **Custom Script**      | User-provided hook scripts    | Single        | Any provider via custom hooks   | **Stable** |

**What the availability column means.** Until now it said `Stable` on all
twenty-nine rows, which is not a status — a column with one value cannot be
wrong about any particular provider, and four of them were wrong:

| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| **Stable** | The plugin is pinned in `requirements.txt`, so it is in the default image. |
| **Extended image** | Pinned in `requirements-extended.txt`. Build with `--build-arg EXTRA_REQUIREMENTS=requirements-extended.txt`. |
| **Separate install** | Not shipped in any image. `pip install` it yourself, in its own environment where noted. |
| **Unavailable** | No usable plugin exists for the supported stack. CertMate can be configured for it, but issuance will fail. |

`Namecheap` is the **Unavailable** one: the only release on PyPI is
`certbot-dns-namecheap` 1.0.0, an alpha targeting Python 2.7-3.8, incompatible
with certbot 2.x on Python 3.12 — as `NamecheapStrategy`'s own docstring has
said all along. Use ACME-DNS or the custom-script hook for Namecheap domains.
`Scaleway` is alpha (0.0.7, declares Python 2.7 support) and `PowerDNS` pulls
`dns-lexicon<=3.5.6`, which conflicts with the rest of the extended set — hence
its own environment.

### Provider Categories

- **Enterprise Multi-Account**: Cloudflare, AWS Route53, Azure DNS, Google Cloud DNS, DigitalOcean, PowerDNS, RFC2136
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS Route53, Azure DNS, Google Cloud DNS, DigitalOcean, Linode, Akamai Edge DNS, Vultr, Hetzner
- **Enterprise DNS**: Cloudflare, DNS Made Easy, NS1, PowerDNS, EfficientIP SOLIDserver
- **Domain Registrars**: Gandi, OVH, Namecheap, Porkbun, GoDaddy 
- **European Providers**: OVH, Gandi, Hetzner
- **Free Services**: Hurricane Electric, Dynu
- **Standard Protocols**: RFC2136 (for BIND and compatible servers)

### Multi-Account Benefits

For supported providers, you can configure multiple accounts to enable:

- **Environment Separation**: Different accounts for production, staging, and development
- **Multi-Region Management**: Separate accounts for different geographical regions
- **Team Isolation**: Department-specific accounts with tailored permissions
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup accounts for high-availability scenarios
- **Permission Scoping**: Accounts with minimal required permissions for security

> **Detailed Setup Instructions**: See [DNS Providers Guide](docs/dns-providers.md) for provider-specific configuration. 
> **Step-by-Step Installation**: See [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for complete setup guide. 
> **Multi-Account Examples**: See [DNS Providers Guide](docs/dns-providers.md#multi-account-support) for enterprise configuration examples.

## Quick Start with Docker

Get CertMate running in under 5 minutes with Docker Compose. One file, the published image, nothing to clone or build.

### Prerequisites
- Docker 20.10+ with Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose`)
- A domain with DNS managed by a supported provider

### 1. Download and configure

```bash
mkdir certmate && cd certmate
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate/main/deploy/docker-compose.yml
printf 'API_BEARER_TOKEN=%s\nSECRET_KEY=%s\nCERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE=%s\n' \
  "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > .env
chmod 600 .env
```

`.env` now holds the three secrets CertMate needs: the API token (also asked once by the first-run screen to create the admin), the session signing key, and the backup passphrase. Optionally add `CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN=...` to bootstrap a Cloudflare DNS account; every other DNS provider is configured in the web UI. What each setting does, and how to upgrade: [docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md#production-with-docker-compose).

> **Storage Backends**: By default, certificates are stored locally. For enterprise deployments, you can configure Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Infisical, or any S3-compatible object storage via the web interface after startup. See [Storage Backends](#certificate-storage-configuration) for details.

> **Backup Best Practices**: CertMate includes a unified backup system that creates atomic snapshots of both settings and certificates. **Set `CERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE`.** With it, every automatic backup is complete and encrypted at rest, so it can actually restore this instance; without it, automatic backups keep their credentials masked and are configuration snapshots that cannot. The backup list marks which archives can restore, and Settings disables Restore on the ones that cannot. Then keep a copy off the host — archives on the host are pruned after 30 days, and a lost volume takes them with it. `POST /api/backups/upload` brings one back.

### 2. Start

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f certmate
```

CertMate listens on `127.0.0.1:8000` only. For remote access, put a reverse proxy in front and set `BEHIND_PROXY=true` in `.env`.

To build from source instead, clone the repository and use its root `docker-compose.yml` (development).

### 3. Access CertMate

| Service                  | URL                          | Description                           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Web Dashboard**        | http://localhost:8000        | Main certificate management interface |
| **API Documentation**    | http://localhost:8000/docs/  | Interactive Swagger/OpenAPI docs      |
| **Alternative API Docs** | http://localhost:8000/redoc/ | ReDoc documentation                   |
| **Health Check**         | http://localhost:8000/health | Service health monitoring             |

### 4. Create Your First Certificate

Using the Web Interface:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8000
2. Go to Settings and configure your DNS provider
3. Add your domain (e.g. `example.com`)
4. Click "Create Certificate"

Using the API:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/certificates/create" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_token_here" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"domain": "example.com"}'
```

## Installation Methods

Choose the installation method that best fits your environment:

### Docker (Recommended)
Isolated, reproducible, and the way CertMate is tested and released. Run **one**
container (see the single-instance note above); give it more CPU and memory
rather than more replicas. **Published images cover two architectures**: AMD64 (Intel/AMD) and ARM64 (Apple Silicon, ARM servers). ARM v7 (32-bit Raspberry Pi) is not published; build it yourself with `./build-multiplatform.sh --platforms linux/arm/v7`.

The production Compose bundle is one file that runs the published image; the [Quick Start](#quick-start-with-docker) above shows the commands. To build the image yourself instead, clone the repository and run `docker compose up -d` with its root `docker-compose.yml`, after preparing its bind-mounted directories as its comments describe.

**Multi-Platform Support:**
```bash
# Build for multiple architectures (ARM64 + AMD64)
./build-multiplatform.sh

# Build and push to Docker Hub for all platforms
./build-multiplatform.sh -r YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME -p

# Use pre-built multi-platform image (bound to localhost; put it behind a
# reverse proxy and enable authentication before exposing it externally)
docker run --platform linux/arm64 -d --name certmate --env-file .env -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 fabriziosalmi/certmate:latest
```

> **Multi-Platform Guide**: See [Docker Guide](docs/docker.md) for comprehensive multi-architecture setup instructions.

### Python Virtual Environment
Ideal for development and testing environments.

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv certmate-env
source certmate-env/bin/activate # On Windows: certmate-env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate.git
cd certmate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export API_BEARER_TOKEN="your_token_here"
export CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN="your_cloudflare_token"

# Run the application
python app.py
```

### Kubernetes
For container orchestration and managed rollouts. **`replicas: 1` is not an
example value** — it is the supported configuration, and the Helm chart fails at
template time if you change it.

Install the Helm chart, published to GHCR on every release:

```bash
kubectl create namespace certmate
kubectl -n certmate create secret generic certmate-secrets \
  --from-literal=API_BEARER_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --from-literal=SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --from-literal=CERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
helm install certmate oci://ghcr.io/fabriziosalmi/charts/certmate \
  --namespace certmate --set secrets.existingSecret=certmate-secrets
```

[CertMate on Kubernetes](docs/kubernetes.md) covers the first login, Argo CD and Flux, production sizing and OOM troubleshooting. Every chart value is in the [chart README](charts/certmate/README.md).

### Linux server with systemd
One command on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL, Rocky or Alma Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate/main/deploy/install.sh | sudo sh
```

The installer puts CertMate in `/opt/certmate` with its own Python 3.12 (fetched by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), so the system Python is not touched), generates the secrets into `/etc/certmate/certmate.env`, and starts the `certmate` systemd service on `127.0.0.1:8000`. Run it again to upgrade: certificates, data and configuration stay. Details and options: [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md#linux-server-with-systemd).

To set the service up by hand instead, follow the next section.

## Service Setup

For production deployments, CertMate should run as a system service. This section provides comprehensive instructions for setting up CertMate with systemd on Linux distributions.

### Prerequisites

- Linux system with systemd
- Python 3.12
- Root/sudo access

### 1. Create Dedicated System User

Create a dedicated user for running CertMate:

```bash
# Create system user and group
sudo useradd --system --shell /bin/false --home-dir /opt/certmate --create-home certmate

# Set proper ownership
sudo chown -R certmate:certmate /opt/certmate
```

### 2. Prepare Application Directory

Set up the application in `/opt/certmate`:

```bash
# Clone straight into the path. `useradd --create-home` above populated
# /opt/certmate from /etc/skel, so it is not empty and `mv certmate /opt/`
# fails with "Directory not empty" — leaving the next steps to run in a
# directory with no application in it.
sudo -u certmate git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate.git /opt/certmate
cd /opt/certmate

# Create Python virtual environment
sudo -u certmate python3 -m venv venv
sudo -u certmate ./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create necessary directories. All four: the startup writeability probe
# in modules/factory.py checks certificates, data, backups AND logs,
# and raises at boot if any of them is not writable.
sudo -u certmate mkdir -p certificates data backups logs
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create environment file for the service:

```bash
# Create environment file
# The unit reads /etc/certmate/certmate.env (see certmate.service), not a
# .env in the application directory.
sudo install -d -m 750 /etc/certmate
sudo tee /etc/certmate/certmate.env > /dev/null <<EOF
# SECURITY: Change this token!
API_BEARER_TOKEN=your_super_secure_api_token_here_change_this
EOF

# PORT has no effect here: the port is the literal in the unit's ExecStart
# (--bind 0.0.0.0:8000), and nothing in the application reads PORT under
# gunicorn. To change it, edit ExecStart. PORT is honoured only by the
# container image.

# Set proper permissions
sudo chown root:certmate /etc/certmate/certmate.env
sudo chmod 640 /etc/certmate/certmate.env
```

### 4. Install systemd Service

Install and configure the systemd service:

```bash
# Copy service file
sudo cp /opt/certmate/certmate.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Reload systemd configuration
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable service to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable certmate

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start certmate
```

### 5. Verify Service Status

Check that the service is running correctly:

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status certmate

# View recent logs
sudo journalctl -u certmate --lines=50

# Follow logs in real-time
sudo journalctl -u certmate -f
```

### 6. Service Management Commands

Common commands for managing the CertMate service:

```bash
# Start service
sudo systemctl start certmate

# Stop service
sudo systemctl stop certmate

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart certmate

# Reload service configuration
sudo systemctl reload certmate

# Check if service is enabled
sudo systemctl is-enabled certmate

# Check if service is active
sudo systemctl is-active certmate

# Disable service from starting on boot
sudo systemctl disable certmate
```

### 7. File Permissions

Ensure proper file permissions for security:

```bash
# Set ownership
sudo chown -R certmate:certmate /opt/certmate

# Set directory permissions
sudo chmod 755 /opt/certmate
sudo chmod 750 /opt/certmate/certificates /opt/certmate/data /opt/certmate/backups /opt/certmate/logs

# Set file permissions
sudo chmod 644 /opt/certmate/*.py /opt/certmate/*.md
sudo chmod 640 /etc/certmate/certmate.env
sudo chmod 755 /opt/certmate/venv/bin/*
```

### Security Notes

- **API Bearer Token**: Always change the default API bearer token in `/etc/certmate/certmate.env`
- **File Permissions**: The service runs with restricted permissions and limited filesystem access
- **Network Access**: The service binds to `0.0.0.0:8000` by default - consider using a reverse proxy for production
- **Environment File**: The `.env` file contains sensitive data and should be readable only by the `certmate` user
- **Certificates**: Generated certificates are stored in `/opt/certmate/certificates` with restricted access

### Troubleshooting Service Setup

If the service fails to start:

1. **Check service status**: `sudo systemctl status certmate`
2. **View logs**: `sudo journalctl -u certmate --lines=100`
3. **Verify permissions**: Ensure the `certmate` user can read all necessary files
4. **Test manually**: `sudo -u certmate /opt/certmate/venv/bin/python /opt/certmate/app.py`
5. **Check dependencies**: `sudo -u certmate /opt/certmate/venv/bin/certbot --version` — the ACME client is the dependency that breaks first when the pins drift.

For more detailed installation instructions, see the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md).

## Single Sign-On (OIDC/SSO)

CertMate supports authenticating users against an external OpenID Connect provider (Keycloak, Authentik, Okta, Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra, ...) using the Authorization Code + PKCE flow. SSO is **additive**: local username/password login and API keys keep working alongside it.

### Configuring an IdP

1. Open the CertMate UI as an admin → **Settings → SSO**.
2. Set the **Issuer URL** to the IdP's base URL (the path before `/.well-known/openid-configuration`). For example:
   - Keycloak: `https://idp.example.com/realms/main`
   - Authentik: `https://idp.example.com/application/o/certmate/`
   - Google: `https://accounts.google.com`
3. Fill in the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** issued by the IdP for the CertMate application.
4. In the IdP, register CertMate's callback URL as a valid redirect URI:

   ```
   https://your-certmate.example.com/api/auth/oidc/callback
   ```

5. Pick the claim names your IdP uses for username (`preferred_username` by default), email (`email`), and role (`groups`). Add **Role mappings** to translate IdP group/role claim values to CertMate roles — first match wins. Anything that doesn't match falls back to the configured **Default role** (`viewer` recommended).
6. Toggle **Enable OIDC/SSO** on and save. Visit `/login` in a new browser session to see the **Sign in with <Provider>** button.

### Role mapping example

For a Keycloak realm that exposes a `groups` claim, the configuration block in `settings.json` looks like:

```json
"oidc": {
  "enabled": true,
  "provider_name": "Keycloak",
  "issuer_url": "https://idp.example.com/realms/main",
  "client_id": "certmate",
  "client_secret": "********",
  "scopes": ["openid", "email", "profile", "groups"],
  "role_claim": "groups",
  "role_mappings": [
    { "claim_value": "certmate-admins",    "role": "admin" },
    { "claim_value": "certmate-operators", "role": "operator" }
  ],
  "default_role": "viewer",
  "auto_create_users": true,
  "link_by_email": true,
  "sync_role_on_login": true
}
```

### Provisioning and linking

- **Just-in-time provisioning** (`auto_create_users`) creates a CertMate user row on first login. The row has an empty password hash so JIT-provisioned SSO accounts cannot fall back to local login.
- **Email linking** (`link_by_email`) detects collisions with existing local users and merges identities — the user keeps **their existing password hash**, so a local-then-linked account can still log in either way during a rollout. Their role is preserved at the moment of linking, and from the *next* login onwards it is governed by `sync_role_on_login` like anyone else's (see below): with the default `true`, a linked local admin whose IdP groups map to `viewer` becomes a viewer on their second login. Disable `link_by_email` if you want JIT-only provisioning with no local-password fallback.
- Subject (`sub` + `iss`) lookup always wins over email matching, so an already-linked SSO user is never accidentally re-merged when their IdP email changes.
- **Role sync** (`sync_role_on_login`, default `true`) re-derives the role from the current claims on every login, so removing someone from an admin group in the IdP demotes them in CertMate too. Set it to `false` when the IdP only authenticates and roles are managed inside CertMate — an admin promoting someone by hand then survives their next login.
- A **disabled** CertMate user is refused at SSO login exactly as at local login: disabling an account locks it out regardless of how it authenticates.

### Security

- PKCE (S256) is enforced for every flow regardless of client type.
- The id_token's signature, audience, issuer, expiry and nonce are validated server-side by Authlib using the IdP's published JWKS.
- `client_secret` is masked (`********`) in every GET response and round-tripped safely through the Settings UI.
- The `oidc` settings block is on the bulk-POST reject list — only the dedicated `/api/auth/oidc/settings` endpoint can mutate it, with full audit.
- Failed callbacks count against the same per-IP rate limit as local login.

## API Usage

CertMate provides a comprehensive REST API for programmatic certificate management. All endpoints require Bearer token authentication.

### Authentication

Include the Authorization header in all API requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_api_token_here
```

### Endpoints

The full reference is **[docs/api.md](docs/api.md)**: every endpoint, the role
it needs, the shape it answers with, and the error format.

This section used to be a second catalogue, and the two had drifted: of the
endpoints each named, six were in both. A reader had no way to tell which was
current, and the reference was missing surfaces this file carried, which is
where the storage backend, backup, metrics and zombie-scan sections in
docs/api.md came from.

A worked example, so the shape is here even if the list is not:

```bash
# Every request carries the token.
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CERTMATE_TOKEN" \
  https://certmate.example.com/api/certificates

# Issue one. The response is the certificate record, not a job id.
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CERTMATE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain": "api.example.com", "dns_provider": "cloudflare"}' \
  https://certmate.example.com/api/certificates/create
```

### Automation-Friendly Download URL

**Certificate downloads for infrastructure automation:**

```bash
# Download every certificate file as one ZIP
GET /api/certificates/{domain}/download
Authorization: Bearer your_token_here
```

This endpoint returns a ZIP file containing all certificate files:
- `cert.pem` - Server certificate
- `chain.pem` - Intermediate certificate chain
- `fullchain.pem` - Full certificate chain (cert + chain)
- `privkey.pem` - Private key

For a single file, use the path form
`GET /api/certificates/{domain}/download/{cert|chain|fullchain|privkey|combined}`.
`privkey` and `combined` require operator; a viewer may pull the public
material only.

### Integration Examples

#### cURL Download
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
 -o example.com-tls.json \
 https://your-certmate-server.com/api/certificates/example.com/download?format=json
```

#### Python SDK Example
```python
import requests
from pathlib import Path

class CertMateClient:
 def __init__(self, base_url, token):
 self.base_url = base_url.rstrip('/')
 self.headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
 
 def download_certificate(self, domain):
 """Download certificate bundle as JSON for domain"""
 url = f"{self.base_url}/api/certificates/{domain}/download?format=json"
 
 response = requests.get(url, headers=self.headers)
 response.raise_for_status()
 return response.json()
 
 def list_certificates(self):
 """List all managed certificates"""
 response = requests.get(f"{self.base_url}/api/certificates", 
 headers=self.headers)
 response.raise_for_status()
 return response.json()
 
 def create_certificate(self, domain, dns_provider=None):
 """Create new certificate for domain"""
 data = {"domain": domain}
 if dns_provider:
 data["dns_provider"] = dns_provider
 
 response = requests.post(f"{self.base_url}/api/certificates/create",
 json=data, headers=self.headers)
 response.raise_for_status()
 return response.json()
 
 def renew_certificate(self, domain):
 """Renew existing certificate"""
 response = requests.post(f"{self.base_url}/api/certificates/{domain}/renew",
 headers=self.headers)
 response.raise_for_status()
 return response.json()

# Usage example
client = CertMateClient("https://certmate.company.com", "your_token_here")

# List and download certificates
certs = client.list_certificates()
bundle = client.download_certificate("api.company.com")
Path("/etc/ssl/certs/api").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
for name, key in {
    "cert.pem": "cert_pem",
    "chain.pem": "chain_pem",
    "fullchain.pem": "fullchain_pem",
    "privkey.pem": "private_key_pem",
}.items():
    Path("/etc/ssl/certs/api", name).write_text(bundle[key])
```

The same JSON response shape can be consumed directly by Ansible's `uri` module or Salt's HTTP helpers without unpacking an archive.

#### Infrastructure as Code Examples

**Terraform:** there is no CertMate Terraform provider. This README used to
show one, with `source = "local/certmate"` and `certmate_certificate`
resources; neither the registry nor any repository has it, so the example
could not be run. Drive the REST API from Terraform with the `http` provider
or a `local-exec`, or use the Ansible and shell examples below, which are
against the real API.

**Bash Automation Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Configuration
CERTMATE_URL="https://certmate.company.com"
API_TOKEN="${CERTMATE_TOKEN}"
DOMAIN="${1:-example.com}"
CERT_DIR="/etc/ssl/certs/${DOMAIN}"

 cp -r "$CERT_DIR"/* "$BACKUP_DIR/" || true
 fi
}

download_certificate() {
 log "Downloading certificate for ${DOMAIN}"
 
 # Download with retry logic
 for i in {1..3}; do
 if curl -f -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
 -o "${DOMAIN}-tls.json" \
 "$CERTMATE_URL/api/certificates/$DOMAIN/download?format=json"; then
 log "Certificate downloaded successfully"
 return 0
 else
 log "Download attempt $i failed, retrying..."
 sleep 5
 fi
 done
 
 log "Failed to download certificate after 3 attempts"
 return 1
}

extract_certificate() {
 log "Extracting certificate to ${CERT_DIR}"
 mkdir -p "$CERT_DIR"
 jq -r '.cert_pem' "${DOMAIN}-tls.json" > "$CERT_DIR/cert.pem"
 jq -r '.chain_pem' "${DOMAIN}-tls.json" > "$CERT_DIR/chain.pem"
 jq -r '.fullchain_pem' "${DOMAIN}-tls.json" > "$CERT_DIR/fullchain.pem"
 jq -r '.private_key_pem' "${DOMAIN}-tls.json" > "$CERT_DIR/privkey.pem"
 
 # Set proper permissions
 chmod 600 "$CERT_DIR"/*.pem
 chown root:ssl-cert "$CERT_DIR"/*.pem
}

reload_services() {
 log "Reloading web services"
 systemctl reload nginx || log "Failed to reload nginx"
 systemctl reload apache2 || log "Failed to reload apache2"
 systemctl reload haproxy || log "Failed to reload haproxy"
}

cleanup() {

### API contract version

Two versions appear in API responses and they answer different questions.

| | what it is | when it moves |
|---|---|---|
| `version` (in `/health`, in the Swagger document) | the **release** number | every release |
| `api_contract_version` (in `/health`), `X-CertMate-API-Version` (on **every** response) | the **interface** | only when this surface changes |

A client deciding whether it still works should read the second. The first moves
on every patch whether or not anything a caller depends on moved with it.

- **minor** bump — the surface grew in a way you can ignore: a new endpoint, a
  new field on a response, a new optional request field;
- **major** bump — something you may depend on went away or changed meaning: an
  endpoint removed, a response field removed or retyped, a request field that
  became required, a status code that changed for an existing condition.

Deprecating something bumps **neither** — that is the point of deprecating
rather than removing.

### Deprecation

An endpoint on its way out answers normally and says so in its headers, so a
client can warn instead of failing:

```
Deprecation: @1757289600                      # RFC 9745 — when it became deprecated
Sunset: Mon, 08 Mar 2027 00:00:00 GMT         # RFC 8594 — earliest it may stop answering
Link: <https://…/docs/api.md#…>; rel="deprecation"
```

Nothing is deprecated today. The headers appear only on an endpoint that is.

### Request validation

The API validates request bodies against the models published in
`/api/swagger.json`. A missing required field or a wrong type is refused with
`400` and a body naming the field, before the request reaches the application.

One consequence worth knowing: **send a field or leave it out — do not send
`null`.** Omitting an optional field means "use the default"; an explicit
`null` is a type error (`"None is not of type 'integer'"`), because `null` is
not an integer.

Values outside a documented `enum` are refused by the application rather than
by the schema, with a message naming the accepted set — for example
`key_size must be one of [2048, 3072, 4096], got 1024`.

## Configuration Guide

### Environment Variables

| Variable           | Required | Default        | Description                         |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `API_BEARER_TOKEN`      |          | auto-generated | Bearer token for API authentication |
| `API_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE` |          | -              | Path to a file containing the API bearer token (takes precedence over `API_BEARER_TOKEN`) |
| `SECRET_KEY`            |          | auto-generated | Flask secret key for sessions       |
| `SECRET_KEY_FILE`       |          | -              | Path to a file containing the Flask secret key (takes precedence over `SECRET_KEY`). **If set and unreadable or empty, CertMate refuses to start** rather than inventing one: a secret that failed to mount is a configuration error, and a fresh key would sign out every user on every restart |
| `PORT`             |          | `8000`         | Server port (honoured by the container entrypoint) |
| `FLASK_ENV`        |          | `production`   | Flask environment. `production` refuses `--debug`  |
| `CERTMATE_LOG_FILE` |         | -              | Also write logs to this path. Off by default: the container logs to stdout, which is what `docker logs` and log shippers expect. Set it (e.g. `/app/logs/certmate.log`) to keep a file on the mounted volume — it is what the web UI's log stream reads |
| `CERTMATE_LOG_MAX_BYTES` |    | `10485760`     | Rotate the log file at this size (10 MB). File logging is always rotated — there is no way to configure an unbounded one |
| `CERTMATE_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT` | | `5`            | How many rotated files to keep (~60 MB ceiling with the default size) |
| `CERTMATE_AUDIT_LOG_MAX_BYTES` | | `10485760`  | Rotate the human-readable audit log (`logs/audit/certificate_audit.log`) at this size. `0` disables rotation. Does **not** apply to the tamper-evident hash chain in `data/audit/`, which is never rotated |
| `CERTMATE_AUDIT_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT` | | `5`       | How many rotated audit logs to keep. Note the Activity page tails only the active file, so it shows fewer entries immediately after a roll |
| `CERTMATE_LOG_LEVEL` |        | `INFO`         | DEBUG / INFO / WARNING / ERROR |
| `CERTMATE_LOG_JSON` |         | `true`         | JSON log lines (set `false` for human-readable) |

#### Deployment and networking

| Variable           | Required | Default        | Description                         |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `BEHIND_PROXY`     |          | `false`        | Trust `X-Forwarded-*` from one reverse proxy hop (`ProxyFix`). Set it only when a proxy actually sits in front: with it on and no proxy, a client can forge its own address, which is what the login rate limit is keyed on |
| `PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME` |      | -              | Set to `https` when TLS terminates in front of CertMate. It marks the session cookie `Secure`, so the browser stops sending it over plain HTTP |
| `CORS_ORIGINS`     |          | -              | Comma-separated origins allowed to call the API from a browser. Empty means the built-in default; this is not a way to open the API to everyone |
| `ACME_CHALLENGES_DIR` |       | `<cwd>/data/acme-challenges` | Where http-01 tokens are written and served from. Override it when the webroot is somewhere else; the hook, the pre-creation and the route all read this one value |
| `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` |         | -              | ACME account email. **Takes precedence over the value saved in the UI**, so an instance that keeps changing its email back is usually this |
| `CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN` |          | -              | Seeds the default Cloudflare DNS account on first start, so a container can be brought up already able to issue. Once settings.json exists the stored value is what is used |

#### Security behaviour

| Variable           | Required | Default        | Description                         |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `CERTMATE_ENABLE_HSTS` |      | `false`        | Send `Strict-Transport-Security`, and mark the session cookie `Secure`. Only set it when TLS really terminates in front — an HSTS header on a plain-HTTP instance locks browsers out of it |
| `SESSION_TIMEOUT_HOURS` |     | `8`            | How long a login session stays valid. The server record and the browser cookie both use this value, so they cannot drift apart |
| `CERTMATE_ALLOW_INTERNAL_WEBHOOKS` | | `false` | Allow notification webhooks to private, loopback and link-local addresses. Off by default because a webhook URL is operator-supplied and an SSRF into the host network is the obvious abuse |
| `CERTMATE_PROBE_ALLOW_PRIVATE` | |  `false`      | Same relaxation for the certificate probe behind `POST /api/probe` (discovery sweeps ignore it and use `monitored_endpoints.allow_private` from settings): allow it to connect to private addresses. Needed to probe a service on the same host, and it removes an SSRF guard |
| `CERTMATE_AUDIT_CHAIN` |      | `1`            | Set `0` to stop writing the tamper-evident audit hash chain. A kill switch, not a tuning knob: with it off, `/api/audit/verify` can no longer prove the log was not edited |
| `AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE` |    | -              | Path to an Ed25519 private key that signs audit checkpoints, so the key can live off this box. If set and unreadable, signing is DISABLED rather than a new key generated — a fresh key would fork the instance's identity and make earlier signatures unverifiable |
| `CERTMATE_ALLOW_SCHEMA_DOWNGRADE` | | `0`       | Set `1` to let this build read and overwrite a `settings.json` or `metadata.json` written by a NEWER version. It will drop fields it does not understand — that is the whole reason it refuses by default |

#### Timing and diagnostics

| Variable           | Required | Default        | Description                         |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `CERTMATE_DOMAIN_LOCK_TIMEOUT` | | `5`         | Seconds to wait for a domain's lock before answering 409 "operation in progress". Clamped to 0-60 |
| `CERTMATE_CERT_INFO_CACHE_TTL` | | `60`        | Seconds a parsed certificate's details stay cached. `0` re-reads from disk on every request. Clamped to 0-3600 |
| `CERTMATE_ISSUANCE_WORKERS` | | `2`            | Threads serving asynchronous issuance jobs. Clamped to 1-16; each one can be running a certbot subprocess |
| `CERTMATE_CERT_DIR` |    | `<install>/certificates` | Where issued certificates live. Absolute, or relative to the working directory. The local storage backend follows it too, unless `certificate_storage.cert_dir` names a directory of its own |
| `CERTMATE_DATA_DIR` |    | `<install>/data`         | Settings, the certificate inventory and the audit chain |
| `CERTMATE_BACKUP_DIR` |  | `<install>/backups`      | Where backups are written and restored from |
| `CERTMATE_LOGS_DIR` |    | `<install>/logs`         | Application and audit logs |
| `CERTMATE_ISSUANCE_QUEUE_LIMIT` | | `20`        | How much unfinished issuance may exist at once, counting queued and running jobs. Clamped to 1-500. Beyond it the async endpoints answer `429 ISSUANCE_QUEUE_FULL` instead of accepting work that will not be reached for hours |
| `CERTMATE_ISSUANCE_JOB_HISTORY` | | `200`      | How many finished issuance jobs stay queryable via `/api/certificates/jobs`. Clamped to 20-2000 |
| `CERTMATE_EVENT_WORKERS` |    | `4`            | Threads dispatching event listeners (deploy hooks, cache invalidation). Clamped to 1-32. Nothing is dropped when they are busy; the backlog is logged instead |
| `CERTMATE_EVENT_MAX_STREAMS` |    | `4`            | Live `/api/web/events/stream` connections held at once. Each one occupies a gunicorn thread and the image runs `--workers 1 --threads 8`, so this leaves half the pool for ordinary requests. Past it the route answers `503` with `Retry-After`. Clamped to 1-64 |
| `CERTMATE_EVENT_STREAM_SECONDS` |    | `900`          | How long one event stream is held before it is closed and the browser reconnects. `EventSource` reconnects on its own, so this is invisible — it bounds what a forgotten tab can hold. Clamped to 30-86400 |
| `CERTMATE_EVENT_DRAIN_SECONDS` |    | `5`            | How long a shutdown waits for queued event dispatches to start before giving up on them. Clamped to 0-60. Whatever is left is logged with its event and domain, so a deploy hook that never ran after a renewal is named rather than lost |
| `CERTMATE_CERTBOT_PROBE_TTL` |    | `300`          | Seconds before the certbot readiness answer is re-checked. Clamped to 30-3600. The probe used to run once per process, so a transient failure at boot made the instance permanently unready and a certbot that broke later never turned `/health/ready` red |
| `CERTMATE_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | | `5`       | Connection timeout of the certificate probe used by discovery sweeps and `POST /api/probe`. Clamped to 1-30. The deployment check has its own, `CERTMATE_TLS_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` |
| `CERTMATE_LAST_USED_PERSIST_SECONDS` | | `60`  | How often a session's "last used" timestamp is written to disk. `0` writes on every request, which is the original behaviour and one write per request |
| `CERTMATE_SLOW_REQUEST_LOGGING` | | `true`       | Log a warning, with the thread's stack, for requests that outlive the threshold below. The stack is what makes a hung request diagnosable after the fact |
| `CERTMATE_SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_SECONDS` | | `30` | How long a request must run before it is reported |
| `CERTMATE_SLOW_REQUEST_SCAN_SECONDS` | | `10`  | How often the watchdog looks for requests that are still running |
| `CERTMATE_SLOW_REQUEST_REPEAT_SECONDS` | | threshold | How often a still-running request is reported again |

### Certificate Storage Configuration

CertMate supports multiple storage backends for certificates, providing flexibility for different deployment scenarios and security requirements. By default, certificates are stored locally on the filesystem, but you can configure enterprise-grade storage backends for enhanced security and compliance.

> **Choosing the Right Storage Backend:**
> - **Local Filesystem**: Perfect for development, testing, and small deployments
> - **Azure Key Vault**: Best for Azure-native environments and Microsoft ecosystem integration
> - **AWS Secrets Manager**: Ideal for AWS infrastructure and cross-region deployments
> - **HashiCorp Vault**: Excellent for multi-cloud environments and advanced secret management
> - **Infisical**: Great for teams wanting open-source secret management with collaboration features
> - **S3-compatible object storage**: One bucket on any S3 endpoint (Hetzner, Contabo, OVHcloud, Scaleway, Exoscale, Wasabi, MinIO, AWS)

#### Local Filesystem (Default)
The default storage backend stores certificates in the local filesystem with secure permissions:

```bash
# Default certificate directory
certificates/
 example.com/
 cert.pem # Server certificate
 chain.pem # Certificate chain
 fullchain.pem # Full chain
 privkey.pem # Private key (600 permissions)
 metadata.json # Certificate metadata (600 permissions)
```

**Configuration:**
- **Directory**: `certificates` (configurable)
- **Permissions**: `600` for private keys, `644` for certificates
- **Backup**: Included in automatic backups
- **Use Cases**: Development, testing, single-server deployments

**Benefits:**
- Zero configuration required
- No external dependencies
- Fast access and operations
- Perfect for getting started

#### Azure Key Vault
Store certificates securely in Azure Key Vault for enterprise-grade secret management:

**Required Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements-azure-storage.txt
```

**Configuration:**
```json
{
 "certificate_storage": {
 "backend": "azure_keyvault",
 "azure_keyvault": {
 "vault_url": "https://yourvault.vault.azure.net/",
 "tenant_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
 "client_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
 "client_secret": "your_client_secret"
 }
 }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Azure-native secret management
- Compliance and audit capabilities (SOC 2, ISO 27001, FIPS 140-2)
- Hardware security module (HSM) protection
- Azure RBAC integration and managed identity support
- Automatic backup and disaster recovery

**Use Cases:**
- Azure-based infrastructure
- Enterprise compliance requirements
- Multi-region Azure deployments
- Integration with Azure DevOps and ARM templates

#### AWS Secrets Manager
Integrate with AWS Secrets Manager for scalable secret storage:

**Required Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements-aws-storage.txt
```

**Configuration:**
```json
{
 "certificate_storage": {
 "backend": "aws_secrets_manager",
 "aws_secrets_manager": {
 "region": "us-east-1",
 "access_key_id": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
 "secret_access_key": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
 }
 }
}
```

For **IAM authentication**, choose **AWS credentials / IAM role (no keys)** in
Settings → Storage, enter the region and leave access keys empty. CertMate uses
the AWS credential chain (for example an EC2 instance profile, ECS task role or
EKS pod identity). An optional **Assume role ARN** uses `sts:AssumeRole` and
refreshes the temporary credentials automatically. Existing key-based settings
still work. If `auth_mode` is absent in a manual configuration, access keys
remain required. Equivalent settings without an additional assumed role:

```json
{"certificate_storage":{"backend":"aws_secrets_manager","aws_secrets_manager":{"region":"eu-west-1","auth_mode":"iam_role"}}}
```

The IAM identity needs `secretsmanager:ListSecrets` (account-wide, resource
`*`) and `GetSecretValue`, `DescribeSecret`, `CreateSecret`, `UpdateSecret`
and `DeleteSecret` for the `certmate/certificates/*` secrets. Assuming a
second role also requires permission to call
`sts:AssumeRole` and a trust policy on the target role. The connection test
reports AWS permission errors rather than treating them as an empty store.

**Benefits:**
- AWS-native secret management
- Automatic encryption at rest with AWS KMS
- Cross-region replication for high availability
- IAM-based access control and fine-grained permissions
- Integration with AWS CloudTrail for audit logging
- Automatic rotation capabilities

**Use Cases:**
- AWS-based infrastructure
- Multi-region deployments
- Integration with ECS, EKS, Lambda
- Compliance with AWS security best practices

#### HashiCorp Vault
Use industry-standard HashiCorp Vault for advanced secret management:

**Required Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements-vault-storage.txt
```

**Configuration:**
```json
{
 "certificate_storage": {
 "backend": "hashicorp_vault",
 "hashicorp_vault": {
 "vault_url": "https://vault.example.com:8200",
 "vault_token": "hvs.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
 "mount_point": "secret",
 "engine_version": "v2"
 }
 }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Industry-standard secret management
- Secret versioning and rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring
- Fine-grained access policies and dynamic secrets
- Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud support
- Advanced authentication methods (LDAP, Kubernetes, AWS IAM)

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-cloud environments
- Complex organizational security requirements
- Dynamic secret generation
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes

#### Infisical
Modern open-source secret management with team collaboration:

**Required Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements-infisical-storage.txt
```

**Configuration:**
```json
{
 "certificate_storage": {
 "backend": "infisical",
 "infisical": {
 "site_url": "https://app.infisical.com",
 "client_id": "your_client_id",
 "client_secret": "your_client_secret",
 "project_id": "your_project_id",
 "environment": "prod"
 }
 }
}
```

**`site_url` must be `https://`** (plain `http://` is accepted only for a loopback address: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `::1`). The Infisical
SDK follows a redirect and sends the request body on, and here the body is the certificate and its
private key; its HTTP client cannot be configured from CertMate, so the one thing CertMate can
refuse is the position where anyone on the path could answer with a redirect. Point it at a server
you trust with the key, which is what storing it there means anyway.

**This backend did not work in v2.44.0 or earlier.** It could not run at all: it imported a module
name the pinned `infisical-python` does not have, and called methods that SDK does not have.

**Benefits:**
- Open-source secret management with transparency
- End-to-end encryption for maximum security
- Team collaboration features and role-based access
- Multi-environment support (dev, staging, prod)
- Git-like versioning for secrets
- Self-hostable for complete control

**Use Cases:**
- Team-based development workflows
- Open-source preference
- Self-hosted secret management
- Multi-environment certificate management

#### S3-Compatible Object Storage
One backend for S3-compatible object storage: Hetzner, Contabo, OVHcloud, Scaleway, Exoscale, Wasabi, self-hosted MinIO, or AWS S3 itself. Each domain is stored as one JSON object, `<prefix>/<domain>.json`, holding the certificate files and their metadata.

**Required Dependencies:** `boto3`, already in `requirements.txt` and `requirements-storage-all.txt` (not in `requirements-minimal.txt`).

**Configuration:**
```json
{
 "certificate_storage": {
 "backend": "s3_compatible",
 "s3_compatible": {
 "endpoint_url": "https://fsn1.your-objectstorage.com",
 "bucket": "certmate",
 "access_key_id": "your_access_key_id",
 "secret_access_key": "your_secret_access_key",
 "region": "us-east-1",
 "prefix": "certmate/certificates"
 }
 }
}
```

For S3-compatible services, use **Access keys** and provide both keys, the bucket and the service's endpoint. Existing key-based configurations continue to work unchanged. `region` defaults to `us-east-1` and `prefix` to `certmate/certificates`.

For **AWS S3 with an IAM role**, select **AWS credentials / IAM role (no keys)** in Settings → Storage, provide the bucket and region, and leave the endpoint URL and access keys empty. Boto3 uses its standard credential chain (for example an EC2 instance profile, ECS task role or EKS pod identity). You can optionally enter an **Assume role ARN** (`arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CertMateS3`): the current identity must have `sts:AssumeRole` permission and the destination role must trust it. CertMate refreshes the temporary STS credentials automatically. The role needs `s3:ListBucket` on the bucket and `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, and `s3:DeleteObject` on `<prefix>/*` (including object existence checks). The **Test Storage Backend** action lists the prefix and reports authentication/permission failures.

For manual `settings.json`, explicitly set `"auth_mode":"iam_role"` to use AWS credentials without keys or an endpoint: `{"backend":"s3_compatible","s3_compatible":{"bucket":"certmate","region":"eu-west-1","auth_mode":"iam_role","assume_role_arn":"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CertMateS3"}}`. Omit `assume_role_arn` to use the attached role directly. Without `auth_mode`, legacy key-pair requirements still apply. The optional off-site S3 backup storage has separate credential settings; this option configures **certificate storage** only.

#### Quick Installation Guide

**Install All Storage Backends:**
```bash
# Install all storage backends at once
pip install -r requirements-storage-all.txt

#### Configuring Storage Backends

**Via Web Interface:**
1. Navigate to Settings → Certificate Storage Backend
2. Select your preferred backend from the dropdown
3. Configure the required credentials and settings
4. Test the connection to verify configuration
5. Save settings and optionally migrate existing certificates

**Via API:**
```bash
# Test storage backend connectivity before switching
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/storage/test" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
 "backend": "azure_keyvault",
 "config": {
 "vault_url": "https://yourvault.vault.azure.net/",
 "tenant_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
 "client_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
 "client_secret": "your_client_secret"
 }
 }'

# Get current storage backend information
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/storage/info" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token"

# Update storage backend configuration. Unlike /api/storage/test, the settings
# go under a key named after the backend, not under "config" — a "config" key
# here is ignored and the backend is saved with no credentials.
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/storage/config" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
 "backend": "hashicorp_vault",
 "hashicorp_vault": {
 "vault_url": "https://vault.example.com:8200",
 "vault_token": "hvs.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
 "mount_point": "secret",
 "engine_version": "v2"
 }
 }'
```

**Migrating Between Backends:**

Migration copies every certificate from a source backend to a target backend,
one domain at a time. When no `source_backend` is given, the source is the
backend currently saved in settings, so migrate **before** switching:
1. Test the new backend (`POST /api/storage/test`)
2. Migrate (`POST /api/storage/migrate`, or the migration tool in Settings)
3. Check the response: `migrated_count`, `failed_count`, and `migration_results`, one `true`/`false` per domain
4. Switch the active backend (`POST /api/storage/config`)
5. Optionally clean up the old storage — CertMate never deletes it

If you already saved the new backend, choose **Local filesystem** (or the
previously configured backend) as **Source backend** in the Settings migration
dialog. The dialog always requires an explicit source choice: when migrating
from bucket A to bucket B within S3, choose the **saved S3 backend** as source,
even though S3 is also selected as the target. The target remains the backend
selected in Settings. Via the API,
include `"source_backend": "local_filesystem"` in the migration request.
A zero-domain result means no certificates were found in that source; check
the source selection and certificate directory rather than assuming the
certificates were copied.

*Migration via API:*
```bash
# Migrate all certificates from current backend to new backend
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/storage/migrate" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
 "target_backend": "aws_secrets_manager",
 "target_config": {
 "region": "us-east-1",
 "access_key_id": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE", 
 "secret_access_key": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
 }
 }'
```

Each certificate's metadata is copied along with its files. There is no
separate verification pass and no rollback: a domain whose copy failed is
reported as `false` in `migration_results`, and the source is left untouched,
so re-running the migration or staying on the old backend are both safe.

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing installations continue working without changes
- New storage backends are opt-in
- Migration is non-destructive (copies certificates)
- Local filesystem remains the default backend

## Security & Best Practices

### Security Considerations

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Assign viewer, operator, or admin roles to each user
- **Scoped API Keys**: Create API keys with specific role permissions and optional expiration
- **Per-Domain Scoping (`allowed_domains`)**: Restrict a scoped API key to a list of domain patterns. Supports exact (`example.com`) and wildcard (`*.example.com`) forms; the wildcard matches subdomains only, not the apex. Out-of-scope requests return `403 DOMAIN_OUT_OF_SCOPE` and are recorded in the audit log. Leave the field empty for unrestricted access (legacy behavior).
- **HMAC-SHA256 Token Hashing**: API tokens are hashed with a server-side HMAC secret, preventing offline brute-force even if the settings file is leaked (backward compatible with pre-2.2.6 SHA-256 hashes)
- **Strong Bearer Tokens**: Use cryptographically secure tokens (32+ characters)
- **Token Rotation**: Regularly rotate API tokens and revoke unused keys
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit tokens to version control
- **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
- **IP Restrictions**: Implement firewall rules to restrict access

#### Settings API Hardening
- **Strict Field Whitelist on `POST /api/settings`**: only documented configuration keys are accepted. Sensitive fields (`api_bearer_token`, `deploy_hooks`, `users`, `api_keys`, `local_auth_enabled`) **cannot** be written through the generic settings endpoint — each has its own dedicated endpoint with its own audit:
  - Users → `POST /api/users`
  - API keys → `POST /api/keys`
  - Deploy hooks → `POST /api/deploy/config`
  - Local auth toggle → `POST /api/auth/config` (admin-only)
  Unknown or rejected keys are returned in a `400` response with a `hint` field pointing at the correct endpoint.
- **Audit Trail for Configuration Changes**: every mutation to settings, the auth-config toggle, users, scoped API keys, and deploy hooks is recorded with operator identity and source IP. Authorization denials (out-of-scope domain access, blocked field writes) are recorded too. Logs are written to `data/audit/certificate_audit.log` as one JSON object per line — pipeable into your SIEM of choice.

#### The Setup Window
Until the first operator credential exists — a local admin with local auth enabled, `API_BEARER_TOKEN`, or OIDC — every request is served as admin to anyone who can reach the instance. So during setup CertMate only **bootstraps**: it creates the first admin and turns login on. API keys and further users are refused with `409 SETUP_BOOTSTRAP_ONLY` until setup is complete, because anything created in that window would be created by whoever was there and would outlive it. API keys that an older version let be created during setup stay valid but are flagged in Settings → API Keys and in the startup log, until an operator confirms or revokes each one.

#### Certificate Security
- **File Permissions**: Private keys stored with `600` permissions
- **Directory Permissions**: Certificate directories with `700` permissions
- **Backup Encryption**: Encrypt certificate backups
- **Access Logging**: Monitor certificate access patterns

#### Secret Storage Hardening
CertMate stores DNS provider credentials, ACME account keys, and (legacy) bearer tokens inside `data/settings.json`. The bearer token itself is migrated to an HMAC-SHA256 hash on first save, but **DNS provider credentials remain in the file in their original form** so they can be passed to certbot plugins. The file is created with `0600` permissions, which is the first line of defense. Recommended hardening, in order of effort:

1. **Use an external secret backend** (already supported): point `certificate_storage.backend` at HashiCorp Vault, Infisical, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault. Issued certificates are stored there transparently, keeping the bearer token + DNS credentials in `settings.json` as the only on-disk secret surface.
2. **Encrypt the underlying volume**: run CertMate's `data/` directory on a LUKS-encrypted partition (Linux), an encrypted APFS volume (macOS), or a Kubernetes `Secret` mounted in a `tmpfs`. This protects credentials at rest even if the host disk is removed or imaged.
3. **Run as a dedicated non-root user** with `data/` owned by that user and `0700` mode. Verify with `ls -la data/` — only the CertMate process user should be able to read the file.
4. **Avoid bind-mounting `data/` from untrusted sources** in Docker. Use a named volume managed by Docker, or a CSI-provisioned volume in Kubernetes, rather than a bind from a multi-tenant host.
5. **Rotate credentials regularly**: DNS provider credentials can be rotated independently of CertMate — issue a new token in the provider console, update Settings, then revoke the old token. CertMate will pick up the new credentials on the next renewal.

> CertMate does **not** currently encrypt secrets at the application layer. If your threat model requires that the same operator who can read `settings.json` should still not be able to read DNS credentials, use option (1) above and configure the per-provider credentials in the external secret backend rather than in CertMate's settings.

#### Network Security
```bash
# Example firewall rules (iptables)
# Allow only specific IPs to access CertMate
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -s 192.168.0.0/16 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j DROP
```

The rules above confine **inbound** access. You can also confine **outbound**
traffic: route CertMate's HTTP(S) egress through a forward proxy and deny it any
other route to the internet, so it can reach only your CA, DNS provider, object
storage, and notification endpoints. With [Secure Proxy Manager](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/secure-proxy-manager)
v3.9.0+ this is a built-in default-deny egress allowlist. See
[Confining outbound traffic](docs/installation.md#confining-outbound-traffic-egress-hardening)
for a worked example.

### Performance Optimization

#### Production Deployment
```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  certmate:
    image: certmate:latest
    deploy:
      # CertMate runs an in-process renewal scheduler and per-domain locks, so
      # it must run as a SINGLE writer. Multiple replicas (or >1 gunicorn
      # worker) each fire the renewal check and would issue duplicate ACME
      # orders and hit the CA's duplicate-certificate rate limit. A host-local
      # flock guards multiple workers/containers on a *shared* data volume, but
      # the safe default is one writer. For HA, front a single active instance
      # rather than scaling this service.
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '1.0'
          memory: 512M
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 256M
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=production
      # The worker and thread counts are fixed in the image
      # (`--workers 1 --threads 8`): one worker because the scheduler runs
      # in-process and a second would duplicate every renewal. GUNICORN_TIMEOUT
      # is the one that is read.
      - GUNICORN_TIMEOUT=300   # the image default; raise it for slow DNS providers
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 60s
```

#### Load Balancing with Nginx
```nginx
upstream certmate_backend {
 server certmate1:8000;
 server certmate2:8000;
 server certmate3:8000;
}

server {
 listen 443 ssl http2;
 server_name certmate.company.com;
 
 ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/certmate.company.com/fullchain.pem;
 ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/certs/certmate.company.com/privkey.pem;
 
 location / {
 proxy_pass http://certmate_backend;
 proxy_set_header Host $host;
 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
 
 # API rate limiting
 limit_req zone=api burst=10 nodelay;
 }
}
```

### Backup and Recovery

CertMate provides comprehensive backup and recovery capabilities built directly into the application, ensuring your certificates and configuration data are always protected.

#### Unified Backup System

**What is Unified Backup?**
- **Atomic Operation**: Creates a single ZIP file containing both settings and certificates
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures settings and certificates are always in sync
- **Prevents Corruption**: Eliminates configuration/certificate mismatches
- **Simplified Management**: One file per snapshot. A disaster-recovery archive (`include_secrets=true`) contains everything needed for complete restoration; the default share-safe archive contains certificates, chains, metadata, the audit chain and the inventory — no credentials and no private keys

**Two kinds of archive:**
- **Share-safe**: settings with every credential masked, and **no private keys** — no ACME `privkey.pem`, no ACME account key, no private-CA key, no `.pfx`. Certificates, chains, metadata, the audit chain and the inventory are all there. The manifest says so (`secrets_masked`, `key_material_excluded`). Such an archive cannot restore an instance on its own: `GET /api/backups` reports it with `can_restore: false` and Settings disables its Restore button. The restore API does not read `can_restore`. It refuses a share-safe archive when this instance already holds certificates; otherwise it restores it, keeping the credentials already in this instance's `settings.json`, or — on an instance with no `settings.json` — leaving every credential masked, to be re-entered before the next renewal.
- **Disaster recovery**: plaintext settings and every key — encrypted at rest when `CERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` is set. This is the archive to keep off-site.

**Which one you get automatically depends on one thing:** whether a backup passphrase is
configured. With `CERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` set, automatic backups are disaster-recovery
archives, encrypted at rest. Without it they stay share-safe, because a complete archive
that cannot be encrypted would be a plaintext credential dump written to disk on every
settings change. Without a passphrase, the instance logs a notice once per process, at the first automatic backup it takes.

CertMate never generates or stores that passphrase: keeping it beside the archive it
protects would make the encryption meaningless. It is yours to set and to keep.

`POST /api/backups/create` with `{"include_secrets": true}` (admin, audited) still takes a
disaster-recovery archive on demand, passphrase or not — a deliberate opt-in.

**Getting a backup back onto a new instance:** `POST /api/backups/upload` (admin,
`multipart/form-data`, field `file`), or the *Restore From Elsewhere* control in Settings.
Uploading only stores the archive under a name CertMate generates — the name you send is
discarded. Restoring it is a separate, explicit step, so an upload is never destructive on
its own.

**Automatic Backups:**
- **Unified Snapshots** - Automatically created when DNS providers, domains, certificates, or application settings are modified. Disaster-recovery archives when `CERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` is set, share-safe otherwise (see above)
- **Retention** - Two rules, whichever hits first: the 50 most recent archives per type are kept (`MAX_BACKUPS_PER_TYPE`), **and any archive older than 30 days is deleted regardless of how few there are** (`BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`). Both are constants, not settings. This is why a disaster-recovery archive must be kept off the host: one left in `backups/unified/` is deleted after 30 days like any other. Logging in no longer writes a backup, so routine sign-ins do not consume restore points
- **Automatic Cleanup** - Pruning runs after every backup, applying both rules above

**Manual Backups:**
- **On-Demand Creation** - Create backups anytime via the web interface or API
- **Download Support** - Export backups for external storage and disaster recovery
- **Comprehensive Coverage** - Includes all DNS configurations, certificates, and application settings

#### Web Interface Backup Management

Access backup features from the Settings page:

```html
<!-- Create backup -->
<button onclick="createBackup('unified', this)">Create Backup</button>

<!-- View and manage existing backups -->
- Download backups for external storage
- Restore from any backup point with atomic consistency
- View backup contents and metadata
- Delete specific backups manually
```

#### API Backup Operations

**Create Backup:**
```bash
# Create backup (settings + certificates); "type" is required
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/backups/create" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"type": "unified", "reason": "manual_backup"}'

# Response (201)
{
 "message": "Backup created successfully",
 "backups": [
 {"type": "unified", "filename": "backup_20241225_120000_123456_manual_backup.zip"}
 ],
 "secrets_masked": true,
 "recommendation": null
}
```

Archives are named `backup_<YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS_ffffff>_<reason>.zip` (UTC timestamp), or
`.zip.enc` when `CERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` is set.

**List and Download Backups:**
```bash
# List all backups
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
 "http://localhost:8000/api/backups"

# Download backup
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
 "http://localhost:8000/api/backups/download/unified/backup_20241225_120000_123456_manual_backup.zip" \
 -o backup.zip
```

#### Backup File Structure

**Backup File (ZIP):**
```
backup_20260821_120000_000000_manual.zip
 backup_metadata.json  # manifest: secrets_masked, key_material_excluded, key_files_excluded, encrypted
 settings.json         # application settings — credentials masked in a share-safe archive, plaintext in a DR one
 certificates/
   domain1.com/
     cert.pem
     chain.pem
     fullchain.pem
     privkey.pem       # DR archive only (include_secrets=true); absent from a share-safe archive
     metadata.json
     live/ archive/ renewal/ accounts/   # certbot lineage (keys under accounts/ and live/ DR only)
 data/
   certs/ca/ca.crt      # ca.key: DR only
   certs/client/...     # client certificates (.key/.pfx: DR only)
   audit/ inventory/
```

#### Recovery Procedures

**Backup Restoration:**

*Web Interface:*
1. Navigate to Settings → Backup Management
2. Select the backup to restore from
3. Confirm restoration (restores both settings and certificates atomically)
4. The page reloads the restored settings; nothing is restarted
5. Verify all certificates and configurations are working

*API Restoration:*
```bash
# Restore from backup
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/backups/restore/unified" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"filename": "backup_20241225_120000_123456_manual_backup.zip", "create_backup_before_restore": true}'
```

#### External Backup Integration

For additional protection, integrate with external backup systems:

**Automated External Backup Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /opt/scripts/backup-certmate-external.sh

BACKUP_DIR="/backup/certmate/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
CERT_DIR="/opt/certmate/certificates"
DATA_DIR="/opt/certmate/data"
RETENTION_DAYS=30

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Download the newest backup that can restore (there is no "latest" alias;
# the list is ordered oldest to newest by name)
LATEST=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/backups \
 | jq -r '[.unified[] | select(.can_restore)] | last | .filename // empty')
[ -n "$LATEST" ] || { echo "No restorable backup on this instance" >&2; exit 1; }
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
 "http://localhost:8000/api/backups/download/unified/$LATEST" \
 -o "$BACKUP_DIR/$LATEST"

# Backup certificates directory
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/certificates.tar.gz" "$CERT_DIR"

# Backup application data
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/data.tar.gz" "$DATA_DIR"

# Encrypt backups (optional)
gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --compress-algo 1 --symmetric \
 --output "$BACKUP_DIR/$LATEST.gpg" \
 "$BACKUP_DIR/$LATEST"

# Cleanup old backups
find /backup/certmate -type d -mtime +$RETENTION_DAYS -exec rm -rf {} \;

echo "External backup completed: $BACKUP_DIR"
```

#### Recovery Procedure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Recovery from backup

BACKUP_DATE="20241225_120000"
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/certmate/$BACKUP_DATE"

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# Restore certificates
tar -xzf "$BACKUP_DIR/certificates.tar.gz" -C /opt/certmate/

# Restore data
tar -xzf "$BACKUP_DIR/data.tar.gz" -C /opt/certmate/

# Set permissions
chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/certmate/certificates
chmod -R 700 /opt/certmate/certificates

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

echo "Recovery completed from backup: $BACKUP_DATE"
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Health Monitoring

#### Built-in Health Checks
```bash
# Basic health check
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health

# Detailed health with auth
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
 http://localhost:8000/api/certificates
```

#### Prometheus Metrics Integration

Nothing to add: `/metrics` is already a registered route
([`modules/web/misc_routes.py`](modules/web/misc_routes.py)), and the metrics
themselves are declared in
[`modules/core/metrics.py`](modules/core/metrics.py). This section used to
show a snippet headed "Add to app.py", which would have registered a second,
unauthenticated `/metrics` on top of the real one.

A ready-to-import **Grafana dashboard**, **Prometheus alert rules**, and an
authenticated **scrape config** ship in [`monitoring/`](monitoring/) — see
[monitoring/README.md](monitoring/README.md). The `/metrics` endpoint requires
the viewer role, so scrape it with a viewer-scoped API token (Bearer) — a
scraper reads, so it does not need admin.

#### Log Aggregation
```yaml
# docker-compose.logging.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
 certmate:
 logging:
 driver: "fluentd"
 options:
 fluentd-address: localhost:24224
 tag: certmate
 fluentd-async-connect: "true"
 
 fluentd:
 image: fluent/fluentd:v1.14
 volumes:
 - ./fluentd/conf:/fluentd/etc
 - ./logs:/var/log/fluentd
 ports:
 - "24224:24224"
 - "24224:24224/udp"
```

### Grafana Dashboard Example
```json
{
 "dashboard": {
 "title": "CertMate SSL Certificate Monitoring",
 "panels": [{
 "title": "Certificate Expiry Status",
 "targets": [{
 "expr": "certmate_certificate_expiry_days < 30",
 "legendFormat": "Expiring Soon ({{domain}})"
 }
 ],
 "alert": {
 "conditions": [{
 "query": {"queryType": "", "refId": "A"},
 "reducer": {"type": "last", "params": []},
 "evaluator": {"params": [30], "type": "lt"}
 }
 ],
 "executionErrorState": "alerting",
 "frequency": "1h",
 "handler": 1,
 "name": "Certificate Expiring",
 "noDataState": "no_data",
 "notifications": []
 }
 }
 ]
 }
}
```

### Built-in Notifications

CertMate includes a built-in notification system configurable from Settings > Notifications:

- **Email (SMTP)** - Certificate expiry warnings and renewal confirmations
- **Slack** - Incoming webhook integration for team channels
- **Discord** - Webhook notifications for Discord servers
- **Telegram** - Bot API messages (bot token + chat ID)
- **ntfy** - Push to an [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) topic (self-hostable); optional access token, per-message priority
- **Gotify** - Push to a self-hosted [Gotify](https://gotify.net) server (server URL + app token, numeric priority)
- **Generic Webhooks** - HTTP POST/PUT/PATCH with HMAC-SHA256 signed payloads, bearer/basic/header authentication, and a JSON **payload template** with `{{placeholders}}` so the body fits whatever receives it — see [docs/webhooks.md](docs/webhooks.md)
- **Weekly Digest** - Scheduled summary of certificate status and upcoming renewals

All notification channels support per-event filtering (created, renewed, expiring, failed) and can be tested from the settings UI.

> **Microsoft Teams:** no dedicated adapter is needed. Use a Teams channel's
> built-in email address (channel → ... → Get email address) as a recipient on
> the Email (SMTP) channel — Teams posts the message into the channel for you.

### Downgrades & Recovery

Downgrading to a version older than the one that wrote `settings.json` is not supported and may result in a broken configuration or loss of accounts. If you see a `DOWNGRADE DETECTED` message in the logs after rolling back, **restore the most recent backup that can actually restore**.

> **Not every backup is a restore point.** Unless `CERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE`
> was set when the backup was taken, automatic backups are written with secrets
> masked and **cannot restore this instance** — they are configuration
> snapshots. On an instance that has never had a passphrase set, the newest
> archive is almost certainly one of those, so picking "the latest" by
> timestamp picks one that will be refused. Ask the API which ones qualify: it
> reports `can_restore` per archive, and `restore_blocked_reason` when it is
> false.

```bash
# Which backups can actually restore, newest first
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/backups \
  | jq -r '.unified[] | "\(.filename)  can_restore=\(.can_restore)  \(.restore_blocked_reason // "")"'

# Restore the newest one whose can_restore is true
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename": "backup_YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS_ffffff_<reason>.zip", "create_backup_before_restore": true}' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/backups/restore/unified
```

If nothing reports `can_restore: true`, this instance has no restore point.
Set `CERTMATE_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE`, take a backup immediately, and keep a copy
off this node — see [Backup and Recovery](#backup-and-recovery).

If you have lost the admin password and cannot log in, use the emergency reset script (requires container shell access):

```bash
docker exec -it certmate python scripts/reset_admin_password.py
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Certificate Creation Failures

**Issue**: `Certificate creation failed: ...` with a DNS-01 challenge error (the text after the prefix is certbot's own)
```bash
# Check DNS propagation
dig TXT _acme-challenge.example.com @8.8.8.8

# Verify DNS provider credentials
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer cf_token" \
 "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify"
```

**Issue**: `Rate limit exceeded`
```bash
# Let's Encrypt rate limits:
# - 50 certificates per registered domain per week
# - 5 duplicate certificates per week
# - 300 new orders per account per 3 hours

# Check rate limit status
curl "https://crt.sh/?q=example.com&output=json" | jq length
```

**Issue**: `Permission denied accessing certificate files`
```bash
# Fix file permissions
sudo chown -R certmate:certmate /opt/certmate/certificates
sudo chmod -R 700 /opt/certmate/certificates
sudo chmod 600 /opt/certmate/certificates/*/privkey.pem
```

#### API Authentication Issues

**Issue**: `401 Unauthorized`
```bash
# Verify token format
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
 http://localhost:8000/api/certificates

# The token cannot be read back: settings.json stores only an HMAC of it
# (api_bearer_token_hash). Compare against what you set in API_BEARER_TOKEN
# or API_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE.
```

**Issue**: lost or forgotten API token
```bash
# Set a new token and restart: at startup, the token from API_BEARER_TOKEN
# (or API_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE) replaces the stored one.
# (32+ characters; a malformed token is ignored and the old one stays.)
openssl rand -hex 32   # put the output in .env as API_BEARER_TOKEN=...
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate certmate
```

#### Docker & Container Issues

**Issue**: `Container won't start`
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs certmate

# Verify environment variables
docker-compose config

# Check port conflicts
netstat -tulpn | grep :8000
```

**Issue**: `Volume mount issues`
```bash
# Fix volume permissions
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./certificates ./data ./logs

# Check volume mounts
docker inspect certmate | jq '.[0].Mounts'
```

#### Deployment Status Shows "Backend: Unreachable"

**Q: All my certificates show "Backend: Unreachable" even though they are issued, served, and downloadable. Is something broken?**

No. The deployment-status badge is an optional health indicator — it does not affect issuance, renewal, or download. CertMate's own process opens a TLS connection to `<domain>:<port>` and compares the served certificate's fingerprint against the stored one. The badge only answers whether CertMate itself can reach the service and see the expected certificate.

- **Deployed** — handshake succeeded and the fingerprint matches.
- **Wrong Cert** — handshake succeeded but a different certificate is served.
- **Unreachable** — CertMate could not open a TLS connection to the domain at all.

**Configuring the probe per certificate**

By default the probe connects on port 443 with a direct TLS handshake (HTTPS). You can change the port and protocol per certificate via the API or the dashboard:

| Protocol | Port (default) | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `https-tls` | 443 | Standard HTTPS |
| `tls` | 465 | SMTPS, IMAPS, or any direct TLS service |
| `smtp-starttls` | 587 | SMTP with STARTTLS (port 25 also works) |

From the **dashboard**, open a certificate's detail panel and click **Configure Probe**, then enter the port and protocol.

From the **API**:

```bash
# Set probe to SMTP STARTTLS on port 587
curl -X PATCH https://certmate.example.com/api/certificates/example.com \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"deployment_port": 587, "deployment_protocol": "smtp-starttls"}'

# Reset to defaults (HTTPS on port 443)
curl -X PATCH https://certmate.example.com/api/certificates/example.com \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"deployment_port": null, "deployment_protocol": "https-tls"}'
```

The probe protocol defaults to the global timeout (3s) and can be tuned via the `CERTMATE_TLS_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` environment variable.

**Global timeout tuning:**

```bash
# Accepts 1–30 seconds; default is 3
CERTMATE_TLS_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=10
```

**"Unreachable" for every certificate** is common in Kubernetes/ingress setups where the CertMate pod cannot dial the public/ingress IP directly (split-horizon DNS, an egress `NetworkPolicy`, or TLS terminated by an ingress controller / load balancer). If the target is merely slow, raise the probe budget or configure the port/protocol to match your topology.

See [docs/kubernetes.md](docs/kubernetes.md#deployment-status-badge-shows-backend-unreachable) for the Kubernetes-specific note. (Reference: [#263](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate/issues/263).)

#### DNS Provider Specific Issues

**Cloudflare**:
```bash
# Verify API token permissions
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here"

# Check zone access
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here"
```

**AWS Route53**:
```bash
# Test AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Check Route53 permissions
aws route53 list-hosted-zones
```

**Azure DNS**:
```bash
# Verify service principal
az login --service-principal \
 -u $AZURE_CLIENT_ID \
 -p $AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET \
 --tenant $AZURE_TENANT_ID

# Check DNS zone access
az network dns zone list
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Docker / gunicorn: CERTMATE_LOG_LEVEL. The stock docker-compose.yml does not
# pass it through, so add it under the certmate service's environment: and
# recreate the container
      - CERTMATE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Development server: --log-level overrides CERTMATE_LOG_LEVEL (default INFO)
python app.py --debug --log-level DEBUG

# FLASK_ENV=production makes --debug refuse to start, by design
FLASK_ENV=development
```


### Reporting Bugs

CertMate ships an in-app bug reporter that produces an actionable issue with one click. When an action fails and you're signed in as admin, the error toast surfaces a **Report this issue** button. Clicking it:

1. Calls `GET /api/diagnostics/snapshot` (admin-only) to collect sanitised operational state — CertMate version, Python version, OS, scheduler status, certificate count, DNS provider name, CA name, challenge type, storage backend, disk free, and the last 5 audit-log entries with all identifiers (resource_id, user, IP address, details, error) stripped.
2. Merges the snapshot with browser-side context (user agent, current page, viewport, the specific error envelope `endpoint` / `status` / `code` / `message` / `hint`).
3. Formats the result as Markdown and copies it to your clipboard.
4. Opens `github.com/fabriziosalmi/certmate/issues/new?template=bug_report.md` with the title pre-filled as `[Bug] <status> <code> on <method> <endpoint>`.

Paste the clipboard contents into the issue body, edit if you want, submit. The flow is fully manual — nothing leaves the install without your explicit click, and you can read everything before submitting (it's right there in the textarea). If your browser blocks the clipboard write or pop-ups, the reporter falls back to a modal with the markdown in an editable textarea and a clickable GitHub link.

### Support Checklist (manual reporting)

If the in-app reporter is unavailable (you're not signed in as admin, or you hit the bug before reaching the UI), please provide:

- [ ] CertMate version/commit hash
- [ ] DNS provider being used
- [ ] Error messages from logs
- [ ] Steps to reproduce the issue
- [ ] Environment details (Docker, Python version, OS)

```bash
# Collect system information manually (equivalent of the in-app snapshot)
echo "=== CertMate Debug Info ==="
echo "Version: $(docker exec certmate python -c 'import modules; print(modules.__version__)')"
echo "Python: $(docker exec certmate python --version)"
echo "OS: $(docker exec certmate cat /etc/os-release | head -2)"
echo "Certbot: $(docker exec certmate certbot --version)"
echo "DNS Plugins: $(docker exec certmate pip list | grep certbot-dns)"
# DO NOT paste settings.json verbatim into a public issue — it contains
# credentials. The /api/diagnostics/snapshot endpoint returns a redacted
# subset; use it instead:
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/diagnostics/snapshot | jq .
```
