    Resolution order (mutually exclusive):
    1. SECRET_KEY_FILE — if set, read the key from that file. A read error or
       an empty file raises SecretKeyUnreadableError and the process stops:
       the operator named a file as the source, and failing to read it is a
       configuration error, not an invitation to invent a different key.
       SECRET_KEY is never consulted (to avoid encouraging both vars).
    2. SECRET_KEY — only checked when SECRET_KEY_FILE is absent. Insecure
       defaults ('', 'your-secret-key-here', 'change-me', 'secret') are
       treated as unset and fall through to step 3.
    3. Persisted generated key — reads data_dir/.secret_key if it exists so
       sessions survive restarts, otherwise generates secrets.token_hex(32)
       and attempts to persist it. A persistence failure is logged but does
       not block startup; sessions will not survive restarts in that case.

    The structured logger has always had a `request_id` field and a LogContext

    which no code assigned, and the slow-request watchdog took the raw
    `X-Request-Id` header — so on the overwhelmingly common case of a caller
    that sends no such header, every log line carried `request_id: null` and
    two lines from the same request could not be told from two lines from
    different ones.

    Three decisions here, none of them obvious:

    * a caller-supplied id is honoured, because the point of the header is to
      let a caller stitch its logs to ours — but only if it is an opaque token
      (see clean_correlation_id). An id reaches a log line and a response
      header, so an unbounded or newline-carrying one would let a caller write
      its own log entries and split the header. A rejected id is REPLACED by a
      generated one rather than sanitised: an id the caller did not send and
      cannot match is worse than an honest new one.
    * the id is echoed back in `X-Request-Id`, so a caller that sent nothing
      can still quote it in a bug report.

    Four things run outside a request: the APScheduler that drives renewals,
    the issuance thread pool behind the async API, the slow-request watchdog,
    and the event bus that delivers deploy hooks. Three of them published a way
    to be stopped and only one was ever called — `IssuanceExecutor.shutdown()`
    had no caller anywhere, and the watchdog's `stop_event` was handed to the
    container and never set. A stop handle nobody calls is not a safety net; it
    reads like one in review, which is worse than not having it.

    Order is the point, not the calls. Producers first, consumers last: the
    scheduler can queue a renewal, a renewal publishes an event, and an event
    dispatches a deploy hook — so stopping the bus first would drain a queue
    that is still being filled. The watchdog goes with them because it only
    reports on requests, and by here there are none.

    Bounded throughout. Nothing here waits for a certbot subprocess or a deploy
    hook: the scheduler is asked not to wait, the pool cancels what no worker
    has started, and the bus drains against a deadline. What could not be
    finished is named in the log rather than waited for.

    Idempotent: `python app.py` calls this on Ctrl-C and atexit calls it again
    on the way out, and under gunicorn only atexit does.
