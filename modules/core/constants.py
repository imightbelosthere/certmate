    A cert directory is identified by the presence of ``cert.pem`` — the
    canonical marker for an issued certificate. This filter excludes:

    * filesystem artifacts like ``lost+found`` (ext-family roots)
    * hidden directories (``.cache``, ``.git``, ...)
    * other subdirectories that happen to share the cert root (mount points
      often collect unrelated folders such as ``certs``, ``config``, ``tmp``)

    Callers that want the raw directory list (e.g. backup) should iterate
    directly with their own policy.

    Reported on issue #99 by @SpeeDFireCZE: running CertMate against a cert

# Shape of each certificate's metadata.json, on the same terms as
# SETTINGS_SCHEMA_VERSION above: bumped only when the shape changes, never with
# the product version. The file records key custody — private_key_state, the
# CSR fingerprint, the CA a private-CA certificate cannot renew without — so a
# downgrade that reads it, understands the fields it knows and writes back the
# rest as absent is a silent data loss on exactly the record that says which
# private key belongs to which certificate.
#
# Enforced at the WRITE, not at startup: there is one of these files per
# domain, and refusing to start over one certificate would turn a data-loss
# risk into an outage. Reading a newer file stays allowed. See
# CertificateManager._save_metadata.
METADATA_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1

# Shape of the HTTP interface, on the same terms as the two schema versions
# above: bumped only when the surface changes, never with the product version.
#
# `certmate_version` and the Swagger document's `version` are both the RELEASE
# number, which moves on every patch whether or not anything a caller depends
# on moved with it — so neither can answer "will my client still work". A
# client that pinned the release number would refuse a patch that changed
# nothing; one that ignored it had nothing else to read.
#
# What each version was is below; the rule for choosing the next one is
# last, immediately above the constant, because that is where the person
# changing the surface is looking. It used to sit above the history, and
# every version added pushed it further from the line it governs until
# tests/test_the_contract_says_when_it_changes.py stopped finding it.
#
# 2.0 because `code` was retyped: on failures raised by the HTTP layer it was
# the status INTEGER while every application error used a string symbol, so one
# API answered in two types under one field name and a client had to check the
# type before it could branch. It is a string everywhere now, and the number a
# caller may have been reading is in `status` on those same responses — a
# one-line migration, and the version is how they learn to make it. By the rule
# below this is a retype, and a retype is a MAJOR; picking the comfortable
# number instead would make the rule decorative.
#
# 2.1 for the bounded issuance queue: the async create/renew/reissue endpoints
# can now answer 429 with code ISSUANCE_QUEUE_FULL when too much issuance is
# already outstanding, where they used to accept it. MINOR rather than MAJOR
# because it is a new code on a status those endpoints could already return —
# every /api/ path goes through the rate limiter, which answers 429 — so a
# client that handles 429 at all needs no change, and one that does not was
# already exposed. What is new is a condition, not a type or a shape.
#
# 2.2 for `expired` and `seconds_left` on every certificate-info response.
# MINOR because nothing changed type or disappeared: `days_left` and
# `days_until_expiry` keep their meaning, whole days, truncated. What is new
# is that a client no longer has to derive validity from them, which it could
# not do correctly: under 24 hours truncates to 0, so `days_until_expiry <= 0`
# called a valid certificate expired, and CertMate's own dashboard did exactly
# that in six places (#829). Both new fields are None on the branch where the
# certificate could not be parsed, because unknown is not the same as fine.
#
# 2.3 for POST /api/client-certs/ca/reset: the client-certificate CA can be
# rebuilt with a subject the operator chooses, and that is a new endpoint. By
# the rule below a new endpoint is a MINOR, and this one arrived without moving
# the number at all: the surface grew and a client polling this version had no
# way to learn it. Nothing compared the route table with the version, which is
# why tests/test_the_contract_moves_with_the_surface.py now does.
#
# 2.4 for `revocation` on every GET /api/inventory record (and a `revocation`
# count in its summary): the last verified OCSP/CRL answer for the certificate,
# or None when it was never checked. None is not "good" — nothing was asked.
# A new response field is a MINOR by the rule below. The route-table snapshot
# in tests/test_the_contract_moves_with_the_surface.py cannot see a new field,
# so this one moved by reading the rule, not because a test demanded it.
#
# 2.5 for POST /api/certificates/check-caa: what the CAA records say about
# issuing a set of names from a given CA, so the create form can warn before
# the order instead of after the CA refuses it. A new endpoint is a MINOR. It
# advises and never gates — the create endpoint does not consult it.
#
# 2.6 for GET /api/inventory/domains: when each tracked domain's registration
# expires, from RDAP or WHOIS, and a `domain_registration` section in the
# inventory config and scan responses. A new endpoint and new response fields,
# so a MINOR. `not_published` is a status, not a missing field: some
# registries (.de, .eu) do not publish expiry, and that is the answer.
#
# 2.7 for PATCH /api/keys/<key_id>: an operator confirms an API key that was
# created while the instance was in setup mode. New endpoint, so a MINOR.
# The same change refuses POST /api/keys, and any user after the first, with
# 409 SETUP_BOOTSTRAP_ONLY while in setup mode. That is a new answer to an
# existing request, which the rule below would call MAJOR. It is a security
# fix instead: a key minted in setup mode was minted by whoever could reach
# the instance, and it outlived setup, so no client could rely on it safely.
#
# 2.8 for POST /api/probe: read the certificate a host is serving right now,
# with the verified revocation answer. The inventory could only probe what its
# configuration named, and deployment-status only a managed domain, so a tool
# that wanted CertMate to answer "what is being served at this host" had no way
# to ask and reimplemented the probe — badly, in at least one case, with a
# revocation status that was assumed rather than checked. A new endpoint is a
# MINOR. A scoped key probes only what its scope covers.
#
# 2.9 for GET /api/inventory/health: what the name-level checks last found —
# SPF, DMARC, MX, the blocklists and the HSTS header — plus a `domain_health`
# section in the inventory config and scan responses. A new endpoint and new
# response fields, so a MINOR. `unknown` is a status a caller must not read as
# a pass: a blocklist that refused the query (every public resolver gets that
# from Spamhaus) has said nothing about the address, and the tool these checks
# came from reported exactly that case as "not listed".
#
# 2.10 for `security_headers` and `disclosure` on GET /api/inventory/health,
# and `check_headers` in place of `check_hsts` in the `domain_health` config.
# New response fields are a MINOR. The config key is read both ways on the way
# in, so an instance configured before this does not silently start making a
# request it had turned off; `check_hsts` is no longer written back, because
# the switch now covers three checks over one request and a name that says
# only one of them would be a lie about what turning it off stops.
#
# 2.11 for `weak_tls` on GET /api/inventory/health, and `check_weak_tls` in the
# `domain_health` config. A new response field is a MINOR. It is the only check
# that opens connections a host did not invite — two handshakes per name,
# offering TLS 1.0 and 1.1 — so it is off by default and the field is absent
# until an operator turns it on. `unknown` there means this build could not
# make the offer, which is not the same as the host refusing it.
#
# 2.12 for `dns_resolver` in the inventory configuration: which nameservers
# this instance asks for its own lookups, used by the name-level checks and by
# CAA. A new field on GET and POST /api/inventory/config, so a MINOR. It
# exists because the blocklist check told operators to "point CertMate at a
# resolver of your own" and there was no way to (#881) — advice for something
# the product did not let you do.
#
# 2.13 for `csr` on POST /api/certificates/<domain>/reissue: a new OPTIONAL
# request field, so a MINOR. It exists because the documented way to rotate a
# CSR-only certificate's key — submit the new CSR the same way, same domain —
# did not work: create answers 409 for a domain that already has one and
# points at reissue, and reissue took no CSR. The only path was delete then
# create, with no certificate in between, on the feature people choose
# precisely because they keep the private key elsewhere (#876 item 6).
#
# 2.14 for filters on GET /api/activity — `operation`, `resource_type`,
# `resource_id`, `user`, `status` — and the `complete` field on its response.
# Optional query parameters and a new response field, so a MINOR.
#
# `complete` is the part worth reading twice. The search walks back until it
# has `limit` MATCHES rather than filtering a tail, because "matches among the
# last hundred" would answer "there are none" for anything older — including
# the bootstrap entries docs/compliance.md sends operators to look for. False
# means it stopped early or could not read the log; only `complete: true` with
# an empty result means there are none.
#
# 2.15 for POST /api/web/update-check and `enabled` on its GET response. A new
# endpoint and a new response field, so a MINOR.
#
# It exists because 2.13's update check shipped with no way to turn it on:
# `UpdateCheck.save_config` was there, nothing called it, and the only route
# was the GET the footer asks. Off by default is the contract; no way to opt in
# is not an opt-in. Both verbs take a bearer token like their neighbour
# /api/web/settings — an instance provisioned over the API could otherwise
# write every other setting and not this one.
#
# 2.16 for the additions in the peer-review sweep. All MINOR — a caller that
# ignores every one of them is unaffected:
#
#   GET /api/client-certs/ca              the CA certificate a relying party
#                                         has to trust. Two comments in
#                                         private_ca.py justified the 0600
#                                         file mode by saying it "is served
#                                         over HTTP by certmate", and nothing
#                                         served it: the only /ca route was
#                                         POST /ca/reset.
#   csr, country, state                   new optional fields on
#                                         POST /api/client-certs/create.
#                                         `generate_key: false` needed a CSR
#                                         and had nowhere to put one, so it
#                                         could only ever 400; C and ST were
#                                         the literals "CH"/"Switzerland" for
#                                         every operator. Both default to what
#                                         was issued before.
#   alias_dns_provider                    new optional field on
#                                         POST /api/certificates/create. PATCH
#                                         and reissue have always read it;
#                                         create accepted it in the body and
#                                         dropped it.
#   client_ca_subject                     now accepted by POST /api/settings,
#                                         which docs/api.md has told operators
#                                         to use since contract 2.3.
#   chain_available                       new field on the probe/discovery
#                                         response: false when the runtime
#                                         cannot read the served chain, so a
#                                         leaf-only result is not read as "no
#                                         intermediate served".
#   POST /api/certificates/zombies/scan
#                                   a fourth status, `unverifiable`, and an
#                                   `unverifiable` count in the summary
#                                   (#924). A wildcard with no probe host
#                                   used to be reported `zombie` — the
#                                   scanner's word for "delete this" — after
#                                   probing the one name a wildcard is
#                                   guaranteed not to cover. MINOR: a new
#                                   value of an existing field and a new
#                                   count. A caller that treats an unknown
#                                   status as "not a finding" is right; one
#                                   that treated `zombie` as authoritative
#                                   was being told something false.
#
#   {{cert}} / {{fullchain}}        two new webhook payload-template
#                                   placeholders, carrying the leaf
#                                   certificate and the chain (#218). They
#                                   also appear in the `variables` list the
#                                   webhook Preview endpoint returns, which
#                                   is where the interface builds its chips
#                                   from. A caller that does not use them
#                                   renders exactly what it rendered before.
#
#   POST /api/inventory/scan 409    a scan that arrives while one is already
#                                   running is declined instead of started
#                                   beside it. Counted as a MINOR because the
#                                   endpoint did not previously recognise that
#                                   condition at all — it ran a second sweep
#                                   and answered 200 for it. A caller that
#                                   does not fire overlapping scans sees no
#                                   change; one that does now gets told, and
#                                   the body still carries every leg's
#                                   summary. Recorded here because the rule
#                                   below can also be read as "a status code
#                                   changed", and a reader should be able to
#                                   disagree having seen the reasoning.
#
#   GET /api/notifications/config   a `url_hint` field on each webhook: the
#                                   ORIGIN of its saved URL, which the response
#                                   otherwise masks whole (#944). The settings
#                                   page showed a name and `********`, so an
#                                   operator could not tell which receiver a
#                                   webhook pointed at. MINOR: a new field on a
#                                   response, which a caller can ignore. Derived
#                                   on read and stripped on save, so it is not
#                                   a new request field. Recorded here because
#                                   it shipped in 2.19 without moving the
#                                   number — see the note under the rule.
#
#   GET /api/notifications/config   an `id` on each webhook, and the same field
#                                   accepted on POST (#950). It is what a
#                                   masked secret is matched back to on save,
#                                   so renaming a webhook no longer drops its
#                                   URL, token and headers. MINOR: a new field
#                                   on a response and a new optional request
#                                   field. A caller that ignores it keeps the
#                                   old `(type, name)` matching, unchanged.
#
#   GET /api/activity               states its ordering for the first time:
#                                   newest first (#941). The code's own
#                                   docstrings always claimed it and the code
#                                   did the opposite, so /activity opened on
#                                   the oldest entry in the log. Counted MINOR
#                                   rather than MAJOR because nothing
#                                   published promised the other direction —
#                                   docs/api.md described the WINDOW ("the
#                                   most recent entries") and never the
#                                   direction within it. A caller that relied
#                                   on ascending was relying on behaviour that
#                                   contradicted the documentation it came
#                                   with, and a reader should be able to
#                                   disagree having seen the reasoning. Same
#                                   for GET /api/web/audit-logs.
#
#   GET /api/certificates[/<domain>]
#                                   a `renewal_info` object: what the CA's ARI
#                                   endpoint said at the last renewal sweep —
#                                   the window, the instant inside it the
#                                   sweep renews at, and which kind of absence
#                                   when there is none (#962). MINOR: a new
#                                   field on a response. Read from a record
#                                   the sweep keeps, so it costs no request to
#                                   the CA.
#
#   POST /api/storage/config        `auth_mode` ('access_keys' | 'iam_role')
#   POST /api/storage/test          and `assume_role_arn` on the S3-compatible
#                                   and AWS Secrets Manager backends (#971,
#                                   contributed by QuentinBtd): the AWS
#                                   credential chain and STS AssumeRole instead
#                                   of static keys. MINOR: new optional request
#                                   fields. An absent `auth_mode` keeps its old
#                                   meaning, access keys required, so a caller
#                                   that ignores it is unaffected. Same change:
#                                   POST /api/storage/migrate now fails when an

#                                   listed, where it used to report an empty
#                                   migration as success. Counted as the bug
#                                   fix it is, not a changed contract: nothing
#                                   promised that a source nobody could read
#                                   holds no certificates.

#                                   empty) on a successful restore (#966): the

#                                   never read private_key_state, so such a
#                                   certificate looked healthy there. 2.28,
#                                   MINOR: a new field on a response.
#
#   POST /api/certificates/create, POST /api/certificates/<domain>/reissue
#                                   `challenge_type` accepts a new value,
#                                   `prevalidated` (#983): a Sectigo SCM

#                                   does not change; it used the CA's default

#                                   existing request field.
#

#                                   on POST and never returned, so a caller
#                                   could set it and not read it. 2.30, MINOR:

#                                   with it, and saving that configuration was
#                                   already admin-only. 2.31. A new answer (403)
#                                   to an existing request, which the rule below
#                                   calls MAJOR; counted as the security fix it
#                                   is, the precedent being 2.7.
#
#   Setup mode (no credential configured yet)

#                                   New answers to existing requests, counted
#                                   as the security fix they are (2.7, 2.31).

#                                   it delivers the certificate, and when the
#                                   template names `privkey_pkcs8` or
#                                   `privkey_traditional` the private key, to an
#                                   HTTPS endpoint. The preview renders the
#                                   request without sending it or reading a file.

#                                   that sends the key must carry
#                                   `config.acknowledge_key_delivery_to` with
#                                   that host. 2.34, MINOR: a new endpoint, a
#                                   new value of an existing request field, and
#                                   a new field on a response.
#
# Bump the MINOR when the surface grows in a way a caller can ignore: a new
# endpoint, a new field on a response, a new optional request field. Bump the
# MAJOR when something a caller may depend on goes away or changes meaning: an
# endpoint removed, a response field removed or retyped, a request field that
# becomes required, a status code that changes for an existing condition.
#
# Deprecating something does NOT bump either — that is the point of deprecating
# rather than removing. It is announced with the Deprecation and Sunset headers
# (see modules/api/deprecation.py) and the removal is what bumps the major.
#
# WHAT CHECKS THIS, AND WHAT DOES NOT. tests/test_the_contract_moves_with_the_
# surface.py compares a snapshot of the ROUTES against the tree, so it catches
# an endpoint appearing or going away and nothing else. The rule above has six
# clauses and that gate sees two. A new field on a response, a field removed or
# retyped, a request field becoming required, a status code changing for an
# existing condition: all of those can ship with this number unmoved, and one
# already did — `url_hint` above went out in 2.19. If you are changing what a
# response CONTAINS rather than which responses exist, this comment is the only
# thing that will stop you, so read the rule and move the number yourself.
