           entry whose ``command`` field fails the current
           ``DeployManager._validate_hook`` rules, the entire restore is
           aborted. Hook commands stored under older, more-permissive
           validator versions (or smuggled in via a tampered backup zip)
           would otherwise execute on the next renewal via ``sh -c`` —
           the pre-restore safety net depends on ``pre_restore_backup``
           which the caller creates before invoking us.

        2. If the backup was created in masked-secrets mode (see
           ``create_unified_backup(include_secrets=False)``), every
           credential field arrives as the ``SECRET_MASK_SENTINEL``
           string. Existing on-disk secrets are preserved via the same
           ``_strip_masked_values`` + deep-merge pipeline used by the
           settings POST path (PR #215). On a fresh restore where no
           on-disk settings file exists yet, the masked sentinels stay
           in place and the response log surfaces a warning so the
           operator knows to re-enter credentials.

        Returns:
            True on a clean restore.
            False if the archive could not be opened or a pre-write safety
            gate declined (see ``last_restore_error`` for the reason).

                and new, so this is not reported as success. ``.failed`` lists
                the member names. Callers that only expect True/False must
                handle this: the API layer turns it into a 500 that names the
