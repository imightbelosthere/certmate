"""Deep TLS certificate probe — inspect the certificate served at host:port.

CertMate's existing deployment-status probe (``modules/api/resources.py``)
opens ``host:443`` and compares only a fingerprint. To build a certificate
inventory we need the *full* served certificate as structured data: subject,
SAN list, serial, SHA-256 fingerprint, validity window, issuer DN, public-key
algorithm/size, signature algorithm, and the served chain where the peer sends
one.

This module provides two independently useful pieces:

* :func:`parse_certificate` — pure, offline parsing of a DER/PEM certificate
  into the structured metadata dict (no network, fully unit-testable).
* :func:`probe_certificate` — connect to ``host:port``, read the served
  certificate with ``getpeercert(binary_form=True)``, and return the parsed
  metadata plus a classified status. It never validates PKI trust (so it can
  still describe an expired or self-signed cert), but it *derives* a clean
  validation summary (expired / not-yet-valid / self-signed / hostname match)
  from the parsed certificate instead of surfacing a bare "error".

Safety:

* An **SSRF guard** resolves the target first and refuses private, loopback,
  link-local, reserved, multicast and unspecified addresses unless the caller
  explicitly opts in (``allow_private=True`` or
  ``CERTMATE_PROBE_ALLOW_PRIVATE``). The validated IP is then pinned for the
  connection with SNI = the original hostname, so a DNS rebind between the
  guard check and the handshake cannot redirect the probe to an internal host.

  The pinning is the one part an outbound proxy takes away: through a CONNECT
  tunnel the proxy resolves the name itself and there is no address to pin.
  The guard still runs and still refuses — it decides whether the connection
  is attempted at all — and a target that resolves to a non-global address is
  never tunnelled, so the case the pinning protects stays on the direct path.
  See :func:`open_probe_transport`.
* The probe is **failure-isolated**: every connection/parse error is caught and
  reported as a status, never raised, so an inventory sweep over many hosts can
  never be stalled or aborted by one bad target.

No new dependencies: only the standard library plus ``cryptography`` (already a
CertMate dependency).
