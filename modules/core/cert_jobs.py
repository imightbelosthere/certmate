"""In-process async certificate issuance for the single-instance MIT build.

Moves the blocking certbot call off the gunicorn request threads onto a small
bounded thread pool, so a burst of concurrent create/renew requests cannot
starve SSE, the dashboard or ``/health``. Jobs are tracked in an in-memory,
bounded registry — acceptable because the MIT deployment is single-process
(scale-out is CertMate-ng's job). A job in flight at restart is lost, but the
per-domain lock plus create/renew idempotency make a re-submit safe.

This is opt-in: the synchronous create/renew path is unchanged. Adapters call
``CertificateService.prepare_*`` inline (cheap, immediate 4xx on bad input)
and submit the blocking ``issue_*`` half here.
