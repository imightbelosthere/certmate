"""Application-level certificate orchestration shared by the REST API
(flask-restx resources) and the web blueprint.

Before this module the create/renew request handling — primary-domain
validation, API-key scope enforcement, settings-driven defaults, the certbot
call and the settings.json write-back — was copied into both
``modules/api/resources.py`` and ``modules/web/cert_routes.py``. The two
copies drifted, and security fixes (e.g. the ``validate_domain`` write-boundary
gate) had to be applied by hand in both places. ``CertificateService`` is the
single owner of that orchestration; the HTTP layers are thin adapters that
parse the request, call the service, and format the response.

The service is framework-agnostic: it never touches ``flask.request``. Callers
pass the resolved auth context (``user`` dict + ``ip_address``) so a scope
denial can be audited here and raised as :class:`DomainOutOfScope`, which the
adapters map to HTTP 403.
