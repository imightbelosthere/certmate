"""ACME Renewal Information (RFC 9773) — asking the CA when to renew.

CertMate decides renewal from one number: `days_left <= renewal_threshold_days`,
default 30. That number is CertMate's opinion, and it is the same opinion for
every certificate and every CA. The CA has a better one, and since RFC 9773 it
publishes it: a `renewalInfo` endpoint that answers, per certificate, a window
during which it would like that certificate replaced.

The window matters most when it moves **earlier**. A CA that has to replace a
batch of certificates — a mis-issuance, a compromised intermediate, a
CA/Browser Forum ruling — announces it through ARI, days before the revocation
lands. An instance that renews on a fixed 30-day rule learns about it when the
certificate stops working.

**What this module does, and what it deliberately does not.**

ARI here can only bring a renewal *forward*. The operator's threshold remains
the backstop, so nothing this module does can delay a renewal that would
otherwise have happened, and a CA that is down, slow, or wrong cannot push a
certificate towards expiry. Honouring the other direction — letting ARI defer
past the operator's threshold — is the half that matters for short-lived
certificates, where a fixed 30-day rule is nonsense against a 6-day
certificate. That needs the certbot 5.x stack for the profiles that issue
them (#395, blocked on #103), so it is not guesswork we have to do now.

**Why this is native rather than certbot's.** `acme` 3.3.0, the version the
stack shipped when this was written, had no ARI method at all: `ClientV2`
exposed nothing for `renewalInfo`, and the `certbot` half was 2.10.0. But ARI
is an unauthenticated GET that only informs *when* — issuance stays exactly
where it is, on certbot. So this did not wait for #103, and the issue that
said it was a child of #103 was reading the dependency the wrong way round.

Since the certbot 5.8 stack (#103), `acme` has `ClientV2.renewal_time` and
`certbot renew` consults ARI itself (it records `[acme_renewal_info]` in the
renewal config). Both exist now and this module still decides when CertMate
brings a renewal forward; whether the two should stay separate is a question
about the scheduler, not something the migration changed.
