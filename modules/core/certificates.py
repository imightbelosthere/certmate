        Azure DNS is currently the only provider that cannot self-discover
        the hosted zone for an ACME challenge: its hook (``azure_dns_hook``)
        chooses among explicit zones. We hand it the list of hosted zones the
        account actually owns (looked up via
        :func:`modules.core.dns_zone_discovery.resolve_zones_for_domains`)
        so its longest-match selects the right zone per challenge. This is what unlocks nested-subdomain wildcards
        against a parent hosted zone — e.g. issuing
        ``*.example2.example.com`` when Azure only hosts ``example.com``.

        **RBAC escape hatch**: if ``dns_config`` carries an explicit
        ``zone_domains`` list (set by the operator on the account), we
        skip the live discovery call and use the supplied list directly.
        That keeps existing Azure service principals working when their
        scope only includes ``Microsoft.Network/dnsZones/TXT/write`` on
        specific zones and lacks ``dnsZones/read`` on the resource group
        — granting the broader read permission for auto-discovery would
        otherwise be a hard prerequisite for the v2.6.10 upgrade.

        For any provider without a discovery hook the legacy single-zone
        shape is preserved: the cert FQDN apex goes into ``_zone_domain``
        and the strategy uses it verbatim. Today that branch is unused
        because Azure is the only entry in the registry, but it keeps
        the contract stable for any future caller / test that still

        Returns one of ``'present'``, ``'missing'``, ``'mismatched'`` or
        ``'external'``.

        ``'external'`` is a CSR-only certificate (#599): the appliance generated
        the key and cannot export it, so its absence here is the feature rather
        than the symptom. Distinguishing it matters because ``'missing'`` forces
        `needs_renewal`, and a CSR-only certificate reissued every renewal sweep
        would burn CA rate limit for a problem that does not exist.

        `get_certificate_info` decided a certificate existed by looking at
        cert.pem alone, so a directory holding a certificate and no key was
        reported healthy with `needs_renewal: false` — and the scheduler then
        left it alone until an expiry that does not matter, because the
        instance cannot serve TLS for that name at all.

        That state is not hypothetical: it is exactly what restoring a
        share-safe backup produces, since those deliberately carry no key
        material. An operator verifying a recovery the obvious way — the API
        lists my certificates with sane expiries — is told the node is fine.

        The mismatch case is checked too, and is the cheaper half of the same
        question: cert.pem from one issuance beside privkey.pem from another
        cannot complete a handshake either, and comparing public numbers
        catches it for RSA and EC alike without needing to know the key type.

        **The answer is remembered per (key bytes, certificate bytes).** This
        is called once per domain by every listing, by every Prometheus
        collection and by every renewal sweep, and the comparison is dominated
        by loading the private key, which OpenSSL validates as it parses.
        Measured on one machine: 51.6 ms for RSA-2048, 275 ms for RSA-4096,
        0.020 ms for EC P-256 — and CertMate's default key shape is RSA-2048,
        so on the common installation this single call was ~99% of the cost of
        reading a certificate's information. It is pure with respect to the two
        files' contents, so hashing both (tens of microseconds) and reusing the
        answer is exact rather than approximate: any change to either file —
        renewal, re-key, a restored backup, a torn publish — changes a digest
        and the comparison runs again. Time is not part of the key, because
        nothing about this answer expires.

            dns_config: Explicit DNS configuration (overrides account lookup)
            account_id: Specific account ID to use for the DNS provider
            staging: Use staging environment for testing
            ca_provider: Certificate Authority provider (letsencrypt, digicert, private_ca)
            ca_account_id: Specific CA account ID to use
            domain_alias: Optional domain alias for DNS validation — the
                delegation TARGET, without the challenge label
                (e.g. 'validation.example.org'). CertMate adds the
                `_acme-challenge.` prefix itself; passing it here is
                rejected by validate_domain, which has no underscore in its
                label pattern.
            alias_dns_provider: Provider managing the ALIAS zone when it
                differs from dns_provider (set via PATCH, issue #129, and
                honoured by renewals). The alias challenge hook runs with
                this provider's account; metadata records it so future
                renewals keep using it.
            san_domains: Optional list of additional domains for Subject Alternative Names (SAN)
            key_type: Optional 'rsa' or 'ecdsa'. If all three key kwargs are
                None the global ``default_key_*`` from settings are applied,
                so callers (legacy web routes, scripts) get the configured
                default for free. Pass an explicit value here to override
                per-domain.
            key_size: RSA key size in bits (only valid with key_type='rsa').
            elliptic_curve: ECDSA curve (only valid with key_type='ecdsa').
            csr_pem: A PEM certificate signing request generated elsewhere
                (#599). When given, CertMate never sees or stores a private
                key: certbot runs in ``--csr`` mode, the domains come from the
                CSR rather than from ``domain``/``san_domains``, and the key
                stays on the appliance that made it. These certificates have no
                certbot lineage, so ``certbot renew`` will not touch them —
                renewal re-runs this command with the stored CSR.
            renewal: Keyword-only, and passed by one caller:
                `_renew_from_stored_csr`, which renews a CSR-only certificate
                by re-running issuance. The certificate is not new, so its
                `created_at` is kept, `renewed_at` is stamped, and the run is
                not counted as a creation; the caller counts the renewal
                (#666, D4).
            replace: Reissue over the existing certbot lineage (#267). The
                same ``--cert-name`` with a different ``-d`` set makes
                certbot replace the lineage's domain set (expand AND
                shrink); ``--renew-with-new-domains`` is added so the
                domain-change confirmation never depends on prompt
                defaults. The old certificate keeps being served until
                certbot succeeds. With ``replace`` the global key-shape
                defaults are NOT applied when no key option is passed:
                emitting them would silently re-key the lineage, while
                omitting the flags makes certbot keep the existing key
                type.

        Extracted from `renew_certificate` (#666), where it was 110 lines in
        the middle of a 390-line method — so every one of the five branches
        below had to be read with the lock held, the artifacts half-built and
        the certbot command half-assembled. The create path was decomposed
        this way first (`_resolve_challenge_and_dns`, `_prepare_issuance`),
        and the two drifting apart is what that issue is about: the
        private-CA trust bundle, the native acme-dns hook and the explicit
        credentials path each reached one path months before the other.

        What certbot is told comes from two units create uses too,
        `_answer_through_plugin` and `_answer_through_alias_hook`, and which
        one applies is decided by the same `_uses_alias_hook` (#666, S3).
        What stays here is where the inputs come from: metadata and today's
        settings, where create has the request. In order:

        1. HTTP-01 — today's webroot;
        2. a stored alias the hook implements — CertMate's own hook, with
           the alias provider's account;
        3. the account is gone from settings — fail fast and say so, as the
           create path already does;
        4. acme-dns, recognised from the provider rather than from metadata,
           so certificates issued before #466 stay renewable without a
           migration;
        5. everything else — the provider's plugin with today's
           credentials, authenticator and wait.

    # instance whose sweep is taking longer every night — and will eventually
    # stop finishing between runs — looked exactly like one that was fine,
    # right up until certificates stopped renewing.
    #
    # Two artefacts fix that, and neither needs a capacity number to be chosen
    # in advance. A small marker file records that a sweep is in progress and
    # how far it has got, so the NEXT sweep can say the previous one did not
    # finish and where it stopped. Four gauges make the same thing a graph.
    #
    # What this deliberately does not do is resume from where the last one
    # stopped. Renewal is idempotent and ordered by settings.json, so a rerun
    # from the start re-examines cheap not-due entries rather than losing work;
    # reordering the sweep to resume would be a behaviour change for a problem
    # nobody has reported yet. Recording the stopping point is what makes that
    # decision possible later, with evidence.
