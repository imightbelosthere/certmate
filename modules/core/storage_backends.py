    `certificate_exists()` used to answer `False` for any exception, so a
    timeout, a 403 or an expired credential all read as "the certificate is not
    there" — a reassuring answer to a question nobody managed to ask, and the
    shape that makes a present certificate get re-issued.

    Two call sites in this file already refused to use it for that reason and
    hand-rolled the probe instead, and AzureKeyVaultBackend carried a comment
    describing the defect rather than fixing it. Three workarounds and no fix
    is what a bad contract looks like from the inside.

    So the contract is now three-valued, and the third value is an exception
    because a bool cannot carry it:

      True   the certificate is there
      False  the certificate is definitely not there
      raise  the backend could not tell, and says which error stopped it

    Every backend narrows to the "absent" signal its own SDK raises, matched
    the way this file already matches hvac's InvalidPath: by class name and by
    error code, not by importing an optional dependency.

    and None is also how it says "there is no Certificate object" — so a
    throttled read, a 403 or a blip made both callers take the Secrets-only
    branch and return that copy *without comparing*. After a renewal that had
    already written the Certificate object, the caller got the certificate the
    renewal replaced.

    A timestamp cannot carry the third value, so it is an exception:

        first and `_store_in_backend` wrote here. Not an ignored variable: a
        split, with the README describing the half that moved.

        The stored value could not simply be honoured, because the shipped
        defaults persist `'certificates'` into every settings.json. Treating
        that literal as "unset" is what lets an existing instance be fixed
        without a migration, and without writing a machine-specific absolute
        path into a settings file that gets backed up and restored elsewhere.

        Anything else is a directory the operator typed, and wins.

        the storage layer behind. That is not "the variable is ignored": it is
        a split. `get_certificate_info` reads through the storage manager
        first and `_store_in_backend` writes to it, so with the variable set
        an instance kept a second tree under its working directory while the
        README said certificates lived where it was pointed.
