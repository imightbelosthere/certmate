"""Is certbot actually able to run? Answered at startup, not at first renewal.

CertMate drives certbot as a subprocess. It is the one dependency without
which nothing the product exists for works — and it was the one dependency
nothing checked. A broken certbot produced an instance that started, reported
`/health` 200 and `/health/ready` 200, scheduled its renewals, and discovered
the problem at the first one: hours later, in a log line, on a certificate
that was by then closer to expiry.

"Broken" here is not hypothetical and not usually "not installed". The failure
this project has actually hit twice is subtler: pip resolves the dependency
set cleanly, the binary is present and executable, and then

    certbot --version

dies on `AttributeError: module 'OpenSSL.crypto' has no attribute 'X509Req'`

because a `cryptography` or `pyOpenSSL` version moved under the pinned ACME
stack. Nothing short of running it detects that — a path check, an `os.access`
or an `importlib.util.find_spec` all say the installation is fine.

So the probe runs the command. Three properties keep that affordable:

* **Once per process.** certbot does not change under a running interpreter,
  so the result is a module-level value. Repeated `create_app()` calls — the
  test suite makes dozens — pay for one subprocess between them.
* **Bounded.** A timeout, and a timeout is a failure: a certbot that cannot
  answer `--version` inside the bound cannot issue a certificate. The bound is
  thirty seconds, which is not generous — it is measured. `certbot --version`
  in the published image imports the whole ACME stack and takes 2-3 seconds
  cold; the first version of this probe used five, and the full test suite
  (many containers on one host) drove it past that and reported a working
  certbot as broken. A startup probe that produces false failures is worse
  than no probe, because the next person to see it red learns to ignore it.
* **Never fatal.** A failed probe records `failed` and lets the app start.
  Refusing to boot would take away the UI an operator needs to diagnose it,
  and would take a working instance offline over a probe that might itself be
  wrong. `/health/ready` returning 503 is the loud part: an orchestrator flips
  the pod out of rotation, for the same reason a dead scheduler does.

A `MockShellExecutor` reports `produces_artifacts = False` — it answers from a
canned script rather than running anything, so its answer about certbot means
nothing. That case records `skipped`, which readiness treats as ready: a
probe that did not run must not be reported as a probe that failed.
