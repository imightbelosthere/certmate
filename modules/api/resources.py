    # Health check endpoint

    # Metrics endpoints

    # Diagnostic snapshot endpoint — closes #150. Powers the "Report this
    # issue" button in the error toast: when an admin hits a recoverable
    # API error, the UI fetches this snapshot, merges it with the
    # client-side context (browser, page, error envelope), formats the
    # whole thing as Markdown, copies it to the clipboard, and opens
    # github.com/issues/new pre-filled. Operators reading the resulting
    # issue see an actionable bug report instead of "doesn't work".
    #
    # Security stance: admin-only via require_role('admin'). The response
    # is built from a fixed allowlist of scalar fields plus a sanitized
    # tail of the audit log — never the full settings tree, never any
    # secret, never resource identifiers from the audit entries
    # (resource_id / user / ip_address / details / error are stripped).
    # Sanitization is enforced inline in this handler, not deferred to a
    # generic mask helper, so a future contributor adding a field is
    # forced to think about whether to include it.

    # Settings endpoints

    # DNS Providers endpoint

    # Certificate endpoints

    # --- Certificate inventory (discovery) -------------------------------- #
    # The inventory is populated by the deep TLS probe (#467), scheduled
    # endpoint discovery (#469) and CT-log monitoring (#470). These endpoints
    # expose it to the dashboard (#471). cert_inventory / cert_discovery /
    # ct_monitor are optional managers (absent in minimal-manager unit setups),
    # so every handler guards for their absence with a 503.










    # Files containing private-key material. A viewer-role caller is
    # permitted to download public certificate material (cert, chain,
    # fullchain) but anything that exposes the private key requires
    # operator role. The default ZIP includes privkey.pem and is
    # therefore also operator-gated. (2026-05-12 API auth audit
    # follow-up: viewer-can-pull-privkey was an information-disclosure
    # surface that the original endpoint exposed.)

    # rather than from the local scope they no longer occupy (#667).
