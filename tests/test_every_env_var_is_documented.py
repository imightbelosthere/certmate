"""Every environment variable the code reads is documented, or is listed here.

Twenty-three of the thirty-nine variables `modules/` and `app.py` read appeared
in neither the README nor `docs/docker.md`. Several govern security behaviour:
`BEHIND_PROXY` decides whether `X-Forwarded-For` is trusted — and the login
rate limit is keyed on the address it produces; `CERTMATE_ENABLE_HSTS` and
`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME` decide whether the session cookie is marked `Secure`;
`CERTMATE_ALLOW_INTERNAL_WEBHOOKS` and `CERTMATE_PROBE_ALLOW_PRIVATE` each
remove an SSRF guard; `CERTMATE_AUDIT_CHAIN=0` turns off the tamper-evident
log.

An undocumented knob is not a secret feature. It is a switch nobody knows is
there, including the person who has to explain the instance's behaviour a year
later — and for these, one that changes the security posture.

The repository already has this shape of test for advertised endpoints and for
the documented port. This is the same idea for the environment, and the census
is taken from the AST rather than from a grep because six of the readers take
the variable name as a *parameter* — `_int_env`, `_env_float`, `_clamp_env_int`
and friends — so a grep for `os.getenv("` misses every variable that reaches
them. The finding that prompted this counted twenty-seven variables by grep;
there are thirty-nine.

Two of those six helpers were found by this file's own control rather than by
reading, which is the argument for the control: a census that quietly stops
seeing a class of readers reports a clean result.

`NOT_OPERATOR_CONFIGURATION` is the reviewable part. Three of the names are set
*for* CertMate by something else — certbot, Kubernetes — and documenting them
as knobs would be wrong, not merely verbose.
