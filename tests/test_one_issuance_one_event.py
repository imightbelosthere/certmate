"""One issuance, one event — through the path the dashboard actually takes.

#916 moved lifecycle publishing into CertificateService, so every adapter
(web, RESTX, the async executor) passes through one place. The async
IssuanceExecutor kept publishing too. The dashboard always sends
`async: true`, so a certificate created or renewed from the UI announced
itself twice: deploy hooks ran twice, webhooks and notifications fired twice,
and a failed async renewal paged twice.

Each part was tested alone: the executor with a stub job, the service with
no executor. Only the composition double-publishes, so this drives the
composition — a real EventBus, a real IssuanceExecutor, a real
CertificateService — with certbot replaced by a manager that answers.
