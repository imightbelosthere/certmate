"""`.env.example` is copied verbatim by every operator. It must be true.

The guard this replaces named two variables — `HOST` and `FLASK_DEBUG` — and
looked for them in two markdown files. It never looked at `.env.example`, the
one file the installation docs in all five languages tell you to copy. So the
template kept advertising, long after #429:

  * `FLASK_DEBUG=False` — read by nothing;
  * `HOST=0.0.0.0` — read by nothing, and it reads as a binding control. An
    operator setting `HOST=127.0.0.1` believed they had bound to loopback while
    the service listened on every interface.

An unreferenced second copy, `.env.template`, was worse still: `LOG_LEVEL`
(the app reads `CERTMATE_LOG_LEVEL`), `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (the app reads
`CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN`, so following that file produced a bootstrap that silently
saw no token at all), and ten commented variables promising environment
configuration for Route53, Azure, Google Cloud DNS and PowerDNS — none of which
has ever existed. It was deleted; the docs all point here.

Naming the offenders one at a time is how the previous guard ended up shorter
than the defect. This one asks the general question instead: does anything read
this?

# block headed "Edit `.env` file with your credentials" — so an operator
# following the most-read file in the repository still filled in
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID or POWERDNS_API_KEY and
# reached a UI that showed the provider unconfigured. Every other DNS provider
# is configured in the web UI or through the API; only CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN
# bootstraps an account from the environment.
