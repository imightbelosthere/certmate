"""One API, one shape for a failure.

Measured against a running instance before this change, three unauthenticated
404s produced three different bodies:

    GET /api/certificates/<unknown>   {"error": "Certificate not found for domain: X"}
    GET /api/does-not-exist           {"code": 404, "error": "Not Found", "message": "..."}
    GET /api/client-certs/<unknown>   {"message": "Certificate not found: X. You have
                                       requested this URI [...] but did you mean
                                       /api/client-certs/<string:identifier>/download/... ?"}

So `code` was a string symbol on some endpoints, the status INTEGER on others,
and absent from the most common 404 of all — including on two endpoints
reporting the identical condition, one of which set CERTIFICATE_NOT_FOUND while
the other set nothing. A client could not branch on the field without checking
its type first, which is the same as not having the field. The SDK this
repository publishes already documented it as "CertMate's machine-readable
error code (e.g. DOMAIN_OUT_OF_SCOPE) when present", so the string was the
intended type all along.

The third shape came from flask-restx's own `abort`, which attaches its keyword
arguments to the exception as `data` and returns that verbatim — so no
`@api.errorhandler` can reshape it, and it also narrated matching routes to an
unauthenticated caller because RESTX_ERROR_404_HELP defaults to on. (The
codebase had set ERROR_404_HELP, which is flask-restful's name for it and does
nothing here.)

These tests drive the real application rather than asserting on source, because
the defect was invisible in every file taken on its own.
