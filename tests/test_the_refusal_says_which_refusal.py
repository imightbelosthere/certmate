"""Two small ones from #876: the create error, and the health grace period.

**Item 8 — the hint sent people to the wrong place, and the prefix was said
twice.**

`certificates.py` raises `RuntimeError('Certificate creation failed: ...')` and
the API prefixed it again, so every certbot failure read

    Certificate creation failed: Certificate creation failed: ...

The worse half is the hint. It matched the substring `rate limit`, which
appears in none of the markers a CA actually sends: the ACME error is
`urn:ietf:params:acme:error:rateLimited` — no space — and the human text is
`too many certificates already issued`, which does not contain the words at
all. Measured before the fix:

    rateLimited: too many certificates -> "Check DNS provider credentials"
    too many certificates (5) issued   -> "Check DNS provider credentials"
    too many failed authorizations     -> "DNS provider authentication failed.
                                           Verify your API credentials."

The third decided the order of the checks. It contains "auth", so it reached
the authentication branch, and an operator was told to rotate credentials that
were working — about a refusal that retrying makes worse. `is_acme_rate_limit`
is now asked first, and it tests the markers rather than guessing at words.

**Item 9 — `--start-period=5s` against docker-compose's 40s.**

Measured: a container reaches its first healthy `/health` in about 7 seconds on
a warm host, so the Dockerfile's grace period was already shorter than a normal
boot. A shorter one buys nothing — it only makes a failing check start counting
against `--retries` sooner — so the two agree on 40s now.
