"""`renew_certificate` was 393 lines and C(36); it is four units now (#666).

The issue's headline was `create_certificate` at F(115), and that half was
done in #916: 115 → 18, 590 lines → 317. Renewal was left, and by the time
the create path had been decomposed it was the worse of the two — C(36) to
create's 21, and the longer function.

Why it mattered here more than the number suggests. Every defect this
repository has found on the renewal path in the last two months was a branch
somewhere in the middle of that method: the private-CA trust bundle that
creation passed and renewal never read, so a private-CA certificate could
never renew; the corrupt-metadata write that destroyed `dns_provider`,
`san_domains` and every `deployment_*` key in one pass; the half-finished
publish that the "not yet due" branch returned past, so nothing retried it.
Each one had to be reasoned about with the domain lock held, the artifacts
half-built and the certbot command half-assembled — and each one was a place
where creation and renewal had drifted, because the two were not comparable
side by side.

The four units, and what each one answers:

* `_prepare_renewal_dns` — what certbot needs to answer the challenge. Five
  cases, and the one place they can be compared with the create path's
  `_resolve_challenge_and_dns`.
* `_reconcile_without_renewal` — certbot said "not yet due"; does what we
  serve still agree with what certbot holds?
* `_publish_renewed_certificate` — a renewal happened: publish, stamp, store,
  report.
* `_renewal_failed` — certbot exited non-zero; raise what the operator needs.

This file is the ratchet. The complexity budget cannot hold it — an entry at
or below the general limit of 40 is rejected by design, and 16 is well under
— so without something here nothing stops the method growing back.
