"""The post-login `next` guard inspected two characters. Browsers strip more.

`safeNextUrl()` in templates/login.html rejected a value whose second
character was `/` or `\\`, to stop `//evil.example` and its backslash
variants. It could not see anything the URL parser removes *before* those
characters matter:

    /<TAB>/evil.example/

has `/` at [0] and a tab at [1], so neither branch fired. The browser then
stripped the tab while parsing, leaving `//evil.example/` — and
`window.location.href` went cross-origin, carrying whatever the login flow
had put in the query or fragment. Carriage return and newline behave the same
way, and the set of characters a parser strips is not ours to track.

Measured against the real WHATWG parser before the fix:

    "/\\t/evil.example/"  -> guard "/\\t/evil.example/"  -> lands on https://evil.example

The guard resolves the value and compares origins now, which is what the
server-side twin in `modules/web/oidc_routes.py` has effectively always done
(`urlparse` strips those characters before the netloc check, so the Python
side was never vulnerable — the two only disagreed because one parsed and the
other guessed).

The function is extracted from the shipped template and run under node, so
this exercises the code the browser gets rather than a Python restatement of
it.
