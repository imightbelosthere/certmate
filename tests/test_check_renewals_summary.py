"""check_renewals must never skip a domain silently.

A malformed entry in settings['domains'] (a bare int, a dict with no
'domain' key, an empty domain string) used to be dropped with no
operator-visible signal, so a typo could silently exclude a domain from
automatic renewal forever. check_renewals now counts every checked /
renewed / failed / skipped entry and returns the summary.
