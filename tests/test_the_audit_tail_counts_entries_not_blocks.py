"""The activity page read 827 KiB to show 100 lines.

`get_recent_entries` walks the audit log backwards in 8 KiB blocks, which is
the right shape — the file rotates at megabytes and the caller wants the end of
it. The stop condition was the wrong quantity:

    while remaining > 0 and len(blocks) <= limit:

One block per entry *asked for*, not per entry *found*. An audit line is a
timestamp, a level and a JSON object: around 170 bytes. So 100 entries live in
two blocks and the loop read a hundred and one.

Measured on a 3.2 MiB log of 20,000 entries:

    limit=10    90,112 bytes ->    8,192
    limit=100  827,392 bytes ->   24,576
    limit=500  3,377,780 bytes (the whole file) -> 90,112

The counter is now the entry marker itself — the same string the parse splits
on — rather than newlines, so a traceback or a non-INFO line in the tail cannot
make the read stop short of the entries it was asked for. And `len(blocks) <=
limit` stays as a second condition, so the pathological case of a tail
containing no entries at all reads exactly what it read before rather than
walking to the start of the file.
