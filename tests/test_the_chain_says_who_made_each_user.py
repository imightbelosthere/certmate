"""A user created during the setup window is attributable, afterwards.

#862 stopped the setup window from being used to plant credentials: while an
instance is in setup mode every request is served as admin, so it may only
bootstrap — the first admin, then local auth. A second user, or an API key,
gets 409.

An API key left over from *before* that change carries `created_by:
'setup_user'`, is badged in the UI and waits for an operator to confirm or
revoke it. A **user** has no such field: `create_user` stores `created_at`,
`role`, `email` and `enabled`, and nothing about who asked for it.

It is recorded anyway, in the place that matters more. The route audits the
creation, and in setup mode `request.current_user` is `setup_user`, so the
hash-chained audit trail carries:

    'create' / 'user' / id='admin' / user='setup_user'

That is a better home for the fact than a field in `settings.json` would be:
the chain is tamper-evident and `settings.json` is not, and one fact with two
homes is how the two start disagreeing. So no field was added — this pins the
property instead, because `docs/compliance.md` now tells operators to rely on
it, and an attribution that silently stopped being written would make that
advice worse than none.

The distinguishing half is the second test. `setup_user` only means something
if an ordinary creation says something else.
