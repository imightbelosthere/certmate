"""A certificate the renewal sweep cannot see must not be passed over in silence.

Reported as #759: a certificate issued from a private CA with a 31-day lifespan
and a 30-day threshold never auto-renewed, and — the detail that matters — the
log carried **nothing at all** for that domain. Not a failure, not a skip.

The threshold arithmetic was not the cause. Reproduced against the real code,
a registered certificate with those numbers is picked up from day zero
(`days_left` 30, `30 <= 30`), and `ca_provider` never enters the decision.

The cause is that `check_renewals` iterates `settings['domains']` and nothing
else, while the rest of the application answers "which certificates exist"
differently:

- `digest.py` takes the **union** of `settings['domains']` and the certificate
  directories, so the digest reports the certificate as expiring;
- `get_certificate_info` reads the disk, so the dashboard shows it, with
  `needs_renewal: true`.

A certificate present on disk and absent from settings is therefore visible
everywhere except in the one component whose job is to renew it — and that
component said nothing, which is why the report reads as a threshold bug.

#789 made the sweep name every such certificate and count it in `unmanaged`,
and stopped there: whether to renew them was a product decision about issuing
certificates, recorded as #792 rather than taken in a bug fix.

#792 took it. The sweep now asks `collect_domain_sources` — the one
implementation of "which certificates exist" — and for a certificate on disk
that no settings entry names it **renews the ones that can say how they were
issued**, then writes them back into settings. "Can say how" is not a second
copy of the renewal path's requirements: the guard calls the same resolver the
renewal will call, so the two cannot disagree.

Everything else is still reported and not renewed — no metadata, no DNS
provider named in it, or a provider that is no longer configured on this
instance. That is the previous behaviour, kept as the fallback rather than
replaced.

The re-registration is not tidiness. Without it the warning returns every night
for the life of the certificate, and a warning that repeats forever is one an
operator learns to scroll past — which is how #759 stayed invisible long enough
to be reported as a threshold bug.
