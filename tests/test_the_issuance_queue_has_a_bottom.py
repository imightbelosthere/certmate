"""Two workers and an unbounded queue is a promise the process cannot keep.

`IssuanceExecutor.submit` accepted everything. The pool has two workers by
default, each one running a certbot subprocess that takes tens of seconds to
minutes, and the queue behind them had no limit — so a client in a retry loop,
or a script walking a domain list, could park hundreds of jobs there. Every one
of those callers got `202 Accepted` and a job id for a certificate that would
not be attempted for hours.

The registry's own bound did not help. `_evict_locked` drops the oldest
*terminal* jobs once over the history cap and deliberately never evicts a job
that has not finished, so a backlog of queued work is not bounded by that cap
either — it is exactly the case the cap declines to touch.

A 429 is the honest answer: the caller learns now, and can come back, instead
of holding a job id that means nothing. The depth behind the refusal is a
gauge, along with the event bus's backlog — whose `pending_dispatches()` had no
caller at all, a number computed for nobody.
