"""Rotating a CSR-only certificate's key does not require deleting it first.

Item 6 of #876. `docs/csr-only-certificates.md` and the UI hint said to submit
the new CSR the same way, same domain. Measured: `create` refuses a domain that
already has `cert.pem` with `409 CERTIFICATE_ALREADY_EXISTS`, and its hint
points at reissue — which took no CSR at all. `prepare_reissue` had no
`csr_pem` parameter.

So the only path was delete, then create, with **no certificate in between**.
On the feature people choose precisely because they keep the private key
somewhere else.

Reissue takes one now. Two things about it are worth stating, because both are
decisions rather than consequences:

* **The validation is not copied.** Create's CSR checks — type, size bound, no
  SANs, no key options, parseable, every name in scope — moved into
  `_check_csr` and both callers use it. A second copy of a scope check is the
  one that stops being updated.
* **Named SANs are refused; inherited ones are replaced.** Reissue inherits the
  current SAN set when the caller names none. A CSR carries its own names, so
  adding the inherited set to them would issue something nobody asked for —
  and refusing on the inherited set would make every CSR rotation of a
  multi-name certificate an error. The distinction is recorded before
  inheritance runs.
