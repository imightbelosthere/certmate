"""Two stop handles were published and never called.

`IssuanceExecutor.shutdown()` had no caller anywhere in the tree, and the
slow-request watchdog's `stop_event` was handed to the container and never set.
Both read in review like a safety net — a reader finds a shutdown method and
stops asking what happens on SIGTERM — and neither ran.

What was actually wired was half of it: app.py's KeyboardInterrupt path stopped
the scheduler and drained the event bus, and only for `python app.py`. Under
gunicorn, which is how the image runs, an atexit hook drained the bus and
nothing else. So a container stopped during an async issuance left the pool's
queued jobs unrecorded anywhere: the registry is in memory, it dies with the
process, and the certificate the operator asked for simply never appeared.

`stop_background_work(container)` is now the single ordered shutdown, called
from atexit (both deployment shapes) and from app.py's Ctrl-C path.

Order is the substance of it. Producers stop before consumers — the scheduler
queues renewals, a renewal publishes an event, an event dispatches a deploy
hook — so draining the bus first would drain a queue still being filled. And
nothing waits: certbot subprocesses and deploy hooks are bounded or abandoned,
never joined, because a shutdown that outlives the container runtime's patience
is a SIGKILL with extra steps.
