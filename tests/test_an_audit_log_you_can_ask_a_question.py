"""`/api/activity` can be asked a question, and says when it did not finish.

The audit trail could only be read as a tail: `get_recent_entries(limit)` with
`limit` capped at 500, no way to narrow. On an instance with history that makes
the record unanswerable for anything older than the last few hundred
operations — including the bootstrap entries `docs/compliance.md` now tells
operators to go and look for. A record you cannot query is half a record.

**The trap this file exists to hold shut.** The obvious implementation filters
what the tail already returned, which answers "matches among the last hundred".
For an old or absent match that returns nothing, and nothing reads as "there
were none" — the exact wrong answer, delivered confidently, to the question the
compliance page asks people to ask.

So the stop condition counts **matches**, not entries, and walks back to the
start of the file when it has to. `complete` says which happened:

* `complete: true` — the search reached the beginning. Empty means there are
  none.
* `complete: false` — it stopped at `limit` matches. Empty means it gave up,
  or it could not read the log at all.

Only the first is safe to act on, which is the same distinction this project
keeps having to make between "no" and "I do not know".
