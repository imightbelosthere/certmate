"""The ACME protocol client must be pinned, and the pins that reason about it
must reason about the version actually pinned.

``acme`` is the most protocol- and security-sensitive package in the tree, and
certbot declares it without an upper bound (``Requires: acme`` on 2.10.0, which
this test was written against; ``acme>=5.8.0`` on the 5.8.0 that replaced it) —
so its version would be whatever PyPI happened to serve, and a clean install
would not be guaranteed to reproduce the one that had been tested.

That is load-bearing rather than tidy. A rationale written on the
``cryptography`` and ``pyopenssl`` pins is stated in terms of a specific acme
version (on the 2.10.0 stack: it import-evaluated ``OpenSSL.crypto.X509Extension``,
which is why pyopenssl could not move; on 5.8.0: the ``cryptography`` window
certbot and acme declare). So the two most carefully reasoned pins in the file
depended on a version nothing enforced, and a silent acme bump would have
invalidated their reasoning while leaving the prose looking authoritative
(#657).
