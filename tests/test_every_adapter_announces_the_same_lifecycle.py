"""A certificate created from the dashboard fired no deploy hook.

`certificate_created` and `certificate_renewed` were published by the
flask-restx resources and by nothing else. The `/api/web/...` routes — the
ones the dashboard actually calls — go to `CertificateService` directly, so
nothing on that path ever reached the event bus.

Measured side by side before the fix:

    POST /api/certificates/create          -> 201, EVENTS=['certificate_created']
    POST /api/web/certificates/create      -> 200, EVENTS=[]
    POST /api/certificates/<d>/renew       -> 200, EVENTS=['certificate_renewed']
    POST /api/web/certificates/<d>/renew   -> 200, EVENTS=[]
    POST /api/web/certificates/batch       -> 200, EVENTS=[]

Which means no deploy hook, no webhook and no notification for anything an
operator did through the interface the product ships with — and the failure
was silent at both ends: the certificate was issued, and the hook simply
never ran.

The publish lives in `CertificateService.issue_create` / `issue_renew` now,
the one place every adapter passes: web, RESTX and the async
`IssuanceExecutor`. Copying it into the web routes instead would have made a
second home for a rule that already had one, which is the shape of most of
the defects this sweep has been closing.
