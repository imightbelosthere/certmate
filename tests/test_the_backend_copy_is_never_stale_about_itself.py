"""The external copy must not carry a warning about itself once it has landed.

`_store_in_backend` was handed the metadata as loaded from disk, and on a
renewal after a failed store that record still says "the external copy is
missing or stale". The store succeeded, the local metadata was then cleared,
and the backend kept the stale sentence. With a cloud backend,
get_certificate_info reads the backend's copy of the metadata, so the dashboard
went on warning about a problem that had already fixed itself: #423's symptom,
from the other side. Found by the #666 map; measured before this fix:
backend copy 'previous store to vault failed', local copy None.
