    The TLS probes honour `HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY` through `urllib`, and
    `urllib.request.getproxies()` is `getproxies_environment() or
    getproxies_macosx_sysconf()`: on a Mac with a system proxy configured, an
    EMPTY environment makes urllib fall through to System Settings, and a
    probe test that expects a direct connection quietly takes the tunnel.

    Clearing the variables is therefore not enough. Setting `no_proxy` is,
    and for a reason worth writing down: `getproxies_environment()` collects
    every variable whose name ends in `_proxy`, `no_proxy` included, so the
    dict is non-empty and the macOS fallback is never reached — while
    `proxies.get('https')` is still None. One variable, deterministic on
    every platform.

    A test that wants a proxy removes `no_proxy` and sets `https_proxy`
    itself; `proxy_bypass` reads the same environment, so leaving `no_proxy`
    in place would bypass the proxy it just configured.

    """Keep `create_app()` out of the checkout's real runtime directories.

    `setup_directories` resolves cert/data/backup/log paths from
    `modules.factory.__file__` — two levels up — and honours no
    override. So any in-process `create_app()` reads and writes the working
    tree's own `data/`, `certificates/`, `backups/` and `logs/`, whatever
    tmp_path the test set up. Thirteen test files do that, and a suite run was
    measurably changing three of those four directories (#702).

    Two consequences, and the second is the dangerous one: running the tests
    mutates the developer's instance, and a test can pass on state an earlier
    run left behind. An assertion that passes for that reason looks exactly
    like one that passes because the code is right.

    Anchoring `__file__` at a temporary tree is the pattern this repo already
    uses in test_csp_img_src_airgap.py and test_advertised_endpoints_exist.py;
    doing it here applies it everywhere without touching production paths, and
    the container image and systemd unit keep resolving exactly as before.

    `templates/` and `static/` are linked back to the real ones, because the
    same `__file__` also locates them (factory.py:1305) — an anchor without
    them would break every test that renders a page, silently at first, since
    a missing template directory is only a warning at startup.

    redirected to /login, and the LAST module in alphabetical order failed with

    unrelated test file.

    Session-scoped, so the number of UI modules no longer has anything to do
