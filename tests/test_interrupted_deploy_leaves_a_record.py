"""A deploy killed part-way must be distinguishable from one that never began.

The deploy history entry, the audit record and the failure event were all
written *after* the command returned. So a hook interrupted by process
termination — SIGKILL, an OOM kill, the container stopped mid-deploy — left
none of them. The history showed nothing, and an operator reading it could not
tell "this hook never ran" from "this hook was half-way through publishing a
certificate when we died".

Those are not the same, and the second is the dangerous one: the target may
hold a partially written certificate, a reloaded service, a key without its
chain — and nothing anywhere says to go and look.

The fix is the shape a job runner uses. A `running` record is appended before
the command starts and superseded by the outcome afterwards. The file is
append-only JSONL, so "superseded" means a second record with the same
`run_id`, folded by the reader.

That leaves one thing to get right, and it is the whole value of the change: a
`running` record means either *this run is going on right now* or *the process
running it died*. Only the process that started it can tell — so the deployer
keeps the ids it has in flight, and that set does not survive a restart. After
a restart every leftover `running` record is reported as `interrupted`, which
is exactly what it is.
