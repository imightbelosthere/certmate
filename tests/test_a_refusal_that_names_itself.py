"""Three from the #591 re-triage where the right answer existed and was lost.

**A cleared Timeout box was a 500.** `_validate_hook` did
`int(hook.get('timeout', DEFAULT_TIMEOUT))` with nothing around it, and the
shipped UI binds `x-model.number` — Alpine emits `null` for an empty numeric
input. `int(None)` is a TypeError, which the deploy-config route's blanket
handler turned into `500 {"error": "Failed to save deploy config"}`. So
clearing a field and pressing Save produced a server error with no clue.

**A missing certificate was a 422.** `renew_certificate` raised
`FileNotFoundError("No certificate found for domain: ...")` inside its try,
and the catch-all re-wrapped every exception as
`RuntimeError(f"Exception: {msg}")`. The `except FileNotFoundError:` arm in
`resources_lifecycle.py` — which returns 404 — was therefore dead code, and
an operator asking to renew something that is not there was told the CA had
refused. Measured on a real manager before the fix:

    tipo sollevato       : RuntimeError
    e FileNotFoundError? : False
    messaggio            : Exception: No certificate found for domain: ...

**A hook that backgrounded anything was a timeout.** `capture_output=True`
makes subprocess wait for EOF on the pipes, and a backgrounded grandchild
inherits them. So `curl ... &` — where the direct child exits at once — was
reported as "timeout after Ns", and the operator could not work around it
either: `_is_command_safe` refuses `>/dev/null`, so the stdio cannot be
detached by hand. Measured with a 2s timeout:

    'sleep 6 &'                pipe : TIMEOUT dopo 2.00s   file : uscito dopo 0.01s
    'echo avviato; sleep 6 &'  pipe : TIMEOUT dopo 2.00s   file : uscito dopo 0.01s
    'sleep 6'                  pipe : TIMEOUT dopo 2.00s   file : TIMEOUT dopo 2.01s

That last line is the control: the fix must stop the timeout firing on a
process that has already exited, not remove the timeout.
