"""The chain must survive a second writer, and must name the fault correctly.

Both halves of this file come from one real incident. On 2026-08-10 the chain on
a development instance failed verification at seq 45, and the verifier reported
"a deletion or reorder" — the vocabulary of tampering, on the one file whose
entire purpose is to be trustworthy evidence.

Nothing had been deleted. Seq 44 and 45 were each written twice, with identical
timestamps, on 2026-06-25, by two `migrate` operations: two processes started
against the same data directory, each recovered the same `_next_seq` at startup,
and each appended with it. The in-process `threading.Lock` cannot see another
process.

So: the append takes an advisory file lock and re-reads the head when the file
grew underneath it, and the verifier distinguishes a repeat from a gap.
