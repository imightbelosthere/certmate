"""The set of API resource classes is a contract, pinned before it is moved.

`create_api_resources` is a single 3,700-line function holding 41 classes as
closures, which is why no route can be imported or tested without constructing
the whole manager graph — and therefore why the HTTP layer is the least covered
code in the project (#662, #667).

Breaking it up moves thousands of lines. This exists so that the move is
verifiable rather than hopeful: whatever the internal arrangement, the factory
must keep returning exactly the same resource names, and every one must still
be a usable Flask-RESTX resource. Written before the first line is moved, so
the net is in place during the work rather than after it.
