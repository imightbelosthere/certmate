"""Regression tests for the certbot stderr sanitiser (internal security
audit, May 2026, finding H3).

Before this fix, when ``certbot`` failed at credential parsing time the
plugin echoed the offending ``.ini`` line verbatim into stderr. The
``CertificateManager.create_certificate`` / ``renew_certificate`` flows
wrapped that stderr into a ``RuntimeError`` whose ``str(e)`` flowed back
into the API response body (``modules/web/cert_routes.py:145, 202``).
Net result: a misconfigured ``dns_azure_sp_client_secret = <REAL>`` line
landed in the JSON 422 the operator saw.

The fix splits the two consumers:

* Issuance logs sanitise stderr and also redact the EAB values from the
  Certbot argv before recording an error.
* The exception that flows into the API response is sanitised:
  credential-bearing lines redact their value, paths to the
  credentials ``.ini`` are replaced with a generic marker, and the
  whole message is capped so a verbose certbot trace cannot bloat the
  response.

Helper lives in ``modules/core/utils.py::sanitize_certbot_stderr`` and
the contract pinned below is what the API depends on. Future regressions
that re-route credential text into the response will fail one of these
test cases.
