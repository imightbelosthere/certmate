"""Renewal timing from the CA, not only from a number we picked (#393).

CertMate renews at `days_left <= renewal_threshold_days`, default 30. That is
CertMate's opinion, identical for every certificate and every CA. Since
RFC 9773 the CA publishes its own, per certificate: a `renewalInfo` endpoint
answering a window during which it wants that certificate replaced. The window
matters most when it moves *earlier* — a batch replacement, a compromised
intermediate, a ruling — which a fixed 30-day rule finds out about when the
certificate stops working.

**What is asserted here, and what is deliberately not.** ARI can only bring a
renewal forward: the configured threshold stays the backstop. So a CA that is
down, slow, or wrong cannot delay a renewal that would otherwise have
happened, and there is a control below for exactly that. Letting ARI defer a
renewal past the threshold is the half that matters for short-lived
certificates, and it waits on #395.

**The encoding was verified against the real endpoint**, not against my
reading of the RFC. `certificate_id` on the certificate `letsencrypt.org`
served on 2026-09-24, asked of `https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org`:

    certID : uVnyjs8i8IbTN0j_dhQYuoLYVYc.BUOTO-OGs6KzrdU08hA7yLZf
    status : 200
    body   : {"suggestedWindow": {"start": "2026-11-02T17:18:36Z",
                                  "end":   "2026-11-04T12:29:25Z"}}

for a certificate expiring 2026-12-03. The first thing that probe produced was
a 404 on an expired certificate of ours, which says nothing — a wrong
identifier and a pruned certificate look identical from here. That is why the
positive control above exists, and why `test_the_encoding_matches_a_real_ca`
below re-runs it rather than trusting this docstring.
