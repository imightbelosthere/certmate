"""The provider table's availability column must match what we actually ship.

It said `Stable` on all twenty-nine rows. A column with one value is not a
status — it cannot be wrong about any particular provider, which is why four
wrong entries sat in the most-read table in the README:

  * **Namecheap** — the only release on PyPI is 1.0.0, an alpha targeting
    Python 2.7-3.8, incompatible with certbot 2.x on Python 3.12. Not a
    judgement call: `NamecheapStrategy`'s own docstring says exactly that, and
    requirements.txt records the removal in a comment. The README called it
    Stable anyway.
  * **Scaleway** — 0.0.7, alpha, still declaring Python 2.7 support. A comment
    in requirements.txt, never a pin.
  * **PowerDNS** — pulls `dns-lexicon<=3.5.6`, which conflicts with the rest of
    the extended set. Not in the default image.
  * **Infomaniak** — pinned in no requirements file at all.

The check below reads the requirements files, which are the only thing that
decides what is in an image, and compares them with what the table claims.
