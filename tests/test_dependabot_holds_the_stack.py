"""A pin the code holds on purpose must be one Dependabot will not reopen.

The ignore list named `certbot`, `josepy` and `acme` — the three obvious ones —
and blocked `certbot-dns-*` at MAJOR only, on the reasoning that minor and
patch fixes are compatible. They are not. Every plugin from certbot's own
release train carries `certbot>=` its own version, so a minor bump drags certbot
off the pin exactly as a major would:

    certbot-dns-route53  2.10.0 -> 2.11.0   requires certbot>=2.11.0
    certbot-dns-azure    2.5.0  -> 2.6.1    requires certbot>=3.0,<4.0

Both minor. The second is the bump `requirements-azure.txt` already documents
as breaking the install — and an open Dependabot PR proposed it. The first is
how `requirements-aws.txt` came to hold 2.11.0 against a 2.10.0 base, which
moved certbot to 3.3.0 in a build that reported success.

Worse, the list left out the pins that actually hold the stack together:
`pyopenssl` (26.2.0+ removes `OpenSSL.crypto.X509Extension`, which `acme`
evaluates at import), `cryptography` (48.0.1 requires that pyopenssl, i.e. the
same crash by another route) and `dns-lexicon`. Nothing stopped a bump to any
of them.

So this checks both directions: every package the requirements files document
as held is ignored by Dependabot, and every ignore entry still corresponds to a
real, documented pin. A list nobody can verify is how this one drifted.
