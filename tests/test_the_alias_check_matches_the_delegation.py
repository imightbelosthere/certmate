"""Four DNS-alias defects, found by the certmate-website session on v2.35.0.

1. **`alias_dns_provider` could not be set at create.** PATCH reads it, reissue
   reads it, `create_certificate` has taken it as a keyword for as long as the
   feature has existed — and the create route dropped it, answering 201. The
   only way to create an alias certificate whose alias zone lives with another
   provider was to create it wrong and then PATCH it.

2. **acme-dns delegations were reported as a mismatch.** The expectation was
   always `_acme-challenge.<alias>`. That is right for the certbot-style alias
   in docs/dns-providers.md, and wrong for acme-dns: `_acme_dns_change` POSTs
   the TXT to the acme-dns subdomain *itself* and requires
   `domain_alias == subdomain`, so the CNAME the operator is told to publish
   points at the bare name. A correct delegation read `status: mismatch`.

3. **The alias check ignored `dns_resolver`.** It went to Cloudflare's DoH
   endpoint whatever the instance was configured to use — while `CheckCAA`, in
   the same API module, honours it. On a split-horizon instance an internal
   delegation that exists was reported `missing`; on an air-gapped one the
   check could only fail.

4. **The docstring's own example was rejected.** `create_certificate` offered
   `'_acme-challenge.validation.example.org'` as the value to pass, and
   `validate_domain` has no underscore in its label pattern.
