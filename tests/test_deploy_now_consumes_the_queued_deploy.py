"""Deploy Now and the deploy that was waiting for the window (#1058).

A hook with a maintenance window is not run when the certificate renews while the window is closed: it is
queued, and `drain_pending` runs it when the window opens. Deploy Now runs the same hook straight away, by
design (#109, #632). What it did not do was take the queued entry off the queue, so the window opened and the
hook ran a second time against the certificate it had already deployed. The reporter's hook only replaces a
file; a load balancer rebind or a service restart does not forgive a second, unannounced run hours later, and
a TARGET that carries the private key would deliver it twice.

What is held here:

* a successful Deploy Now consumes the matching queue entry, for hooks and for targets, and a second run does
  not happen when the window opens;
* a FAILED Deploy Now leaves it: the window deploy is then the retry;
* only the entries it handled: another domain, another hook, a hook it did not run;
* an entry queued AGAIN while Deploy Now was running stays, because a certificate newer than the one that run
  read is waiting behind it. That is a race, so it is tested as one: once by constructing the interleaving,
  and once with real threads and an invariant that must hold under any interleaving;
* the same rule in `drain_pending`, which said "only drop what this drain handled" and did it by key, so an
  entry re-queued while it ran was dropped with the one it had just run.
