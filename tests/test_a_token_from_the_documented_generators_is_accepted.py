"""A token made the way the documentation says to make it is never refused for being random (#1057).

`validate_api_token` refused 0.19% of the tokens `openssl rand -hex 32` makes ("too many repeating
patterns": some 3-character window turned up three times by chance, in about 1 token in 580), and
1.7% of the 32-character ones `openssl rand -hex 16` makes (fewer than 12 distinct characters, by
chance). A refused `API_BEARER_TOKEN` makes CertMate refuse to start, so the user who did exactly what
the README says got a service that does not come up. The refusal names the cause, which is no comfort
to someone whose token was fine.

What this holds, and what it does not:

* the two STRUCTURAL rules (repetition, variety) never fire on a random token from any generator the
  documentation names. Sampled with a fixed seed, so the result is the same on every run;
* the weak-PATTERN rule (`12345`, `qwerty`...) is outside that claim, deliberately: it exists to catch a
  value copied out of the documentation, and a random token contains `12345` by chance about once in
  12,000. That residue is measured below and bounded, not hidden;
* the tokens the rules exist to refuse are still refused, and the threshold sits BETWEEN the two groups
  with room on both sides (a margin test, so moving it cannot quietly cross over).
