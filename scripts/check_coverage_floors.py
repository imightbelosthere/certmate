"""Per-module coverage floors for the HTTP layer and the core (#662).

The gated suite already has a project-wide `--cov-fail-under`. One number
cannot protect a layer: `modules/api/resources_ca.py` sat at 11% — 99 of its
111 statements never executed — while the project figure stayed comfortably
above its floor, because 3,800 well-covered statements elsewhere absorbed it.
That is the specific failure #662 describes: the network-exposed
request-handling and settings-mutation code was both the least covered and the
part whose confidence rested on paths the everyday gate does not run.

So each module gets its own floor, set from what it actually achieves. This is
a ratchet, not a target: raise a floor when coverage climbs, and never lower
one to make a build pass — a floor lowered to accommodate a regression is the
regression, recorded.

Two failure modes this deliberately does NOT allow:

* a module in the list that is missing from the report. Renaming or deleting a
  file would otherwise silently drop its floor, and the check would go on
  passing while covering less;
* a module in the report that is not in the list. A new HTTP module would
  otherwise arrive unguarded, which is exactly how resources_ca reached 11%.
