"""A budget for broad exception handlers, instead of a number that only grows.

#671 counted 397 `except Exception` handlers, 7 silent `pass` bodies and 1 bare
`except:`. Measured again today, with the AST rather than grep: **425** broad
handlers, **0** silent bodies among them, **0** bare. Two of the three numbers
were fixed and the third grew by 28 while the issue stayed open, because
nothing measured it between one reading and the next.

So the two that reached zero become rules, and the one that grows becomes a
ratchet. Same shape as scripts/check_complexity_budget.py, for the same reason:
one number for the whole tree is set by its worst file, and everything below
the worst is ungated.

`except Exception` is not a defect on its own. A supervisor loop, a health
probe, a best-effort cache write: all of them genuinely want to survive
anything. What is a defect is the count climbing without anyone choosing it,
and a handler that swallows the exception without recording it, which is why
the second rule is absolute rather than budgeted.

Five failure modes, all of them ones this repository has met:

* a bare `except:` appears. There were none left; this keeps it that way.
* a broad handler whose body is only `pass`. The exception is not handled, it
  is discarded, and nothing downstream can tell the difference between "this
  worked" and "this failed and we decided not to say".
* the total grows past the pin. This is the number #671 is about.
* a file not in the budget goes over GENERAL_LIMIT, or a budgeted file exceeds
  its own entry. Locality: the total alone cannot tell one file improving from
  another getting worse.
* a budgeted file gets BETTER and its entry is not lowered. This is how the
  complexity pin at 559 survived its own fix for nine months, reading like an
  enforced limit while enforcing nothing.

The entries are not targets. They are what the tree measures today, and they
move down.

# 425 -> 427 on 2026-09-16, for the client CA reset (#578), and written down
# because that is what raising this is supposed to cost. Both are the kind the
# docstring above calls defensible, and both LOG:
#
#   modules/api/client_certificates.py   the new resource's catch-all, the same
#                                        `except Exception -> logger.error ->
#                                        abort(500)` every sibling resource in
#                                        that file already has.
#   modules/core/client_certificates.py  the guard around the audit record, the
#                                        same shape as _audit_scheduled_renew
#                                        directly above it. The reset has
#                                        already happened when it runs: letting
#                                        the failure propagate would make the
#                                        caller retry and regenerate the CA a
#                                        second time.
#
# A third one was removed rather than counted: it wrapped CRLManager.update_crl(),
# which already catches internally and returns None, so it could never fire.
#
# 426 -> 427 on 2026-09-22, for the CAA explanation on a failed issuance:
#
#   modules/core/certificates.py   _caa_explanation. It runs inside the branch
#                                  that is already raising certbot's failure,
#                                  and anything it raises would replace that
#                                  error with its own. It logs and returns ''.
#
# Two more were narrowed instead of counted, both in modules/core/caa.py: the
# resolver factory now catches ImportError only, and the per-name catch-all
# went, because every dnspython failure is already a DNSException that the
# resolver turns into LookupFailed.
#
# 427 -> 428 on 2026-09-22, for the domain registration step of the inventory
# scan:
#
#   modules/api/resources_inventory.py   InventoryScan runs discovery, the CT
#                                        poll and now the registration check,
#                                        each in its own `except Exception ->
#                                        logger.error -> error entry`, so one
#                                        failing step cannot lose the other
#                                        two's results. The same shape as the
#                                        two handlers directly above it.
#
# The sweep itself (DomainRegistrationManager.run_check) has no catch-all: a
# single lookup never raises, and anything else is left to the scheduler
# wrapper, which already logs it and records the run.
#
# 428 -> 430 on 2026-09-22, for the name-level checks (SPF/DMARC/MX/blocklists/
# HSTS). Both LOG:
#
#   modules/api/resources_inventory.py   the scan's domain-health step, the
#                                        same shape as the three steps above
#                                        it, for the same reason.
#   modules/core/domain_health.py        DomainHealthManager.check_one. This is
#                                        where it differs from the registration
#                                        sweep above: that one checks each
#                                        domain through a client that turns
#                                        every failure into a status, so it can
#                                        leave the rest to the wrapper. This one
#                                        runs five checks per name against
#                                        injected lookups, and one name's
#                                        surprise must not cost the other two
#                                        hundred their sweep. It records the
#                                        name as `unknown`, never as passing,
#                                        which is what

# (#876 item 10). LOGS.
#
#   modules/factory.py        stop_background_work's new checkpoint step. It
#                             could have been narrowed: write_checkpoint
#                             catches Exception itself and returns None, so in
#                             practice only a manager without the method can
#                             escape it. It is broad anyway, because the
#                             contract of that function is that NOTHING escapes
#                             it — every other step in it (scheduler, issuance
#                             executor, event bus) is broad for the same
#                             reason, and an audit checkpoint must never be why
#                             a container fails to stop. Narrowing this one to
#                             AttributeError would make it the single step that
#                             can take the process down, which is a worse
#                             answer than a number going up by one.
# 431 -> 429 on 2026-09-24, removing the prometheus Info fallback cascade.
#
#   modules/core/metrics.py   Three handlers around `certmate_info.info()`:
#                             an `except AttributeError` that built a Gauge
#                             instead, an `except Exception` inside it, and a
#                             trailing `except Exception`. The AttributeError
#                             fired on EVERY call, on every prometheus_client
#                             this project has pinned, because an Info with
#                             labelnames is a family and `.info()` on the
#                             parent is not a thing. So the handler was not a
#                             fallback for an older library — it was the only
#                             path that ever ran, and the "try" half had never
#                             worked in any release. Declaring the Gauge
#                             directly leaves one call that cannot raise.
#
# 429 -> 421 on 2026-09-25, working the unaccounted list below to zero. Eight
# came off by narrowing or removal rather than by explanation:
#
#   ValueError around `response.json()`, `json.loads` and two `urlparse`
#   calls — a fault that is not a parse failure was being reported to the
#   operator as one;
#   (OSError, ValueError, UnicodeError) around the webhook SSRF guard's
#   resolution, which is every way it can actually fail;
#   (DNSException, OSError) around the UDP-then-TCP retry in the RFC 2136
#   hook, so a programming error there is no longer turned into a second
#   query;
#   RuntimeError around a session read outside a request context;
#   and one REMOVED: `warn_if_bearer_token_hash_is_stale` opened
#   API_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE itself and returned in silence, a second spelling of
#   `_operator_supplied_token` — which this same pin's previous entry had
#   already fixed. It calls that instead now.
# 421 -> 422 on 2026-09-27, for showing the CA's ARI window (#962). LOGS.
#
#   modules/core/certificates.py  _renewal_info_for, the reader of a display
#                             field. It runs inside _parse_certificate_info's
#                             try, whose except branch reports the certificate
#                             as unparseable with needs_renewal: True — so a
#                             defect in this reader, of whatever class, would
#                             become a renewal. Narrowing it would protect
#                             only against the failures already foreseen,
#                             which the body handles itself; the handler is
#                             for the ones that were not. The writer beside it
#                             was narrowed to OSError instead.
# 422 -> 421 on 2026-09-29: IssuanceExecutor._publish is gone with the
# executor's own lifecycle events (the double-publish fix). One broad handler
# fewer, because the thing it guarded no longer exists.
# 421 -> 420 the same day: _publish_renewed_certificate's try/except around
# "apply warning + save metadata" went with the shared _commit_certificate
# (#666). Neither call can raise: _save_metadata returns a bool and logs.
# 420 -> 419: the dead _atomic_binary_copy (no callers; its docstring still
# claimed the renew path used it) went, and its broad handler with it.
TOTAL_LIMIT = 419

# Broad handlers that neither record the failure nor carry a comment saying why
# silence is correct. This is the tractable half of #671: `except Exception` is
# often the right call, but a handler that discards the exception AND says
# nothing about it leaves no way to tell a path that worked from one that
# failed and decided not to mention it.
#
# Two of these were fixed in the commit that added this pin, and both had
# turned a failure into a confident answer: the storage health check answered
# "ok" when it could not read the backend, and the API_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE reader
# returned "no token supplied" for a file it could not open, so an operator who
# rotated the token there got 401 with nothing in the log.
#
# A comment satisfies this, deliberately. The aim is that the silence be
# chosen, and a reader can judge a stated reason; they cannot judge an absence.
#
# Zero, so this is a RULE now and not a ratchet, like the bare and silent ones
# above. The thirty that were left went one of three ways, and the split is the
# useful part of that pass: eight were narrowed to the exception they actually
# expect or removed outright, four were route handlers that discarded the cause
# entirely (`modules/web/backup_cache_routes.py` had no logger at all, so an
# operator got "Failed to list backups" and the log said nothing), and the rest
# were broad for a good reason that nobody had written down — mostly "the
# failure is the return value", which is invisible to this checker and to the
# next reader alike.
