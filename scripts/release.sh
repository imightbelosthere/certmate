# CertMate release - the single, gated path to a release. Fail-closed: any gate
# that does not pass aborts the release. No step depends on remembering to run
# it. Mirrors the process the repo already enforces (fresh branch off main,
# squash-merge, tag, GH release) and the real-cert policy (path-aware, with an
# explicit, logged override for non-issuance patches only).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release.sh prepare X.Y.Z [--skip-real-cert "reason"] [--dry-run]
#       Validate + run every gate, then (unless --dry-run) branch off main,
#       bump the version, commit, push and open the release PR.
#   scripts/release.sh publish X.Y.Z
#       After that PR is merged to main: tag vX.Y.Z and create the GH release
#       from docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md. Run this only once CI is green.
#
# Gates (prepare): flake8 (syntax/undefined), bandit, unit+integration suite,
# UI (Playwright), real-cert E2E (LE staging via Cloudflare from .env), Docker
# build. The unit suite includes the version-consistency and CI-marker-coverage
# guards. Docker must be running for the UI and real-cert gates.

# Paths whose change makes the real-cert E2E MANDATORY (issuance pipeline).
#
# FAIL-CLOSED BY DESIGN. This used to be an allowlist of prefixes —
# `modules/core/(certificate|client_cert|deployer|acme|storage)|modules/dns|...`
# — and it had rotted badly by 2026-08-08:
#
#   * `modules/dns` matched nothing at all. There is no such directory; the DNS
#     code lives at modules/core/dns_*.py. The branch was dead, so a change to
#     dns_providers.py, dns_strategies.py, dns_alias_hook.py or
#     dns_zone_discovery.py did NOT make the real cert mandatory — in the gate
#     written precisely because two DNS providers had each shipped in a state
#     where they had never worked in any release.
#   * Sixteen issuance-critical files were uncovered in total, including
#     modules/core/shell.py, which is how certbot is invoked at all.
#
# The lesson is not "add the missing prefixes" — the next rename breaks it
# again, silently, and nobody reads a regex this long closely enough to notice.
# So the rule is inverted: everything that can reach a certificate is sensitive,
# and the escape hatch exists only for changes that provably cannot (docs, CI,
# the site, static assets, tests other than the issuance ones).
#
# The asymmetry justifies it. A false positive costs one Let's Encrypt staging
# issuance, about four minutes, which is already the default behaviour. A false
# negative ships a DNS provider that cannot issue.
#
# tests/test_release_gate.py asserts every branch below matches a real path, so
# a dead branch fails the suite instead of silently disarming the gate.
