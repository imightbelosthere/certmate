"""A complexity budget per function, instead of one number for the whole tree.

CI used to run `flake8 --select=C901 --max-complexity=115`. That number is the
tree's real worst — `register_settings_routes` — and a test keeps it from
drifting above what the tree contains, so it is not a lax pin in the way the
old 559 was.

It is still a gate that cannot fail on anything anyone is likely to write. One
number for 1,700 functions has to be set by the worst of them, so everything
below the worst is ungated: a new function at 100, or a second closure at 90,
enters the codebase with the lint step green. The pin protects the record for
the single worst function and nothing else.

So the ceiling is per function. Everything gets `GENERAL_LIMIT`; the thirteen
functions already above it are listed here with the value they measure today,
and each is checked against its own entry rather than against the worst.

Four failure modes, all of them ones this repository has actually met:

* a function not in the budget goes over the general limit — the case the
  single pin could not see, and the reason this exists;
* a budgeted function gets worse than its entry — the ratchet's own direction;
* a budgeted function gets BETTER and the entry is not lowered — how 559
  survived #667 by nine months, in a comment that read like an enforced limit;
* a budget entry matching nothing — a rename or a deletion would otherwise
  drop a ceiling silently, and the check would go on passing over less.

The entries are not targets. Twelve of the thirteen are route-registration
closures: N handlers nested inside one registration function, the same shape as
the 559-complexity closure #667 decomposed. Their number goes down when one is
decomposed, never up to accommodate another handler.
